The U.S Navy plans to construct a new $450 million flagship museum. This is according to a recent statement by Secretary of the Navy Kenneth Braithwaite. The new museum will be located at the Navy Yard facility in D.C. The new museum will replace the existing National Museum of the U.S. Navy, which has been at the Washington Navy Yard for over 50 years. The old museum was housed in Building 76 that was formally a former gun factory at the Navy Yard. The new museum is expected to be completed and opened in 2025. There are few details about the project given it is an active installation with tight security and limited public access. The facility is currently closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “The ideal site for the new . . . museum is in the vicinity of the . . . Washington Navy Yard, but the final location is not yet finalized,” the Navy said in a statement. The new site “will give the public unfettered access to U.S. Navy history and heritage.” The Navy has also announced that it is acquiring another six acres of land outside the Navy Yard. In the statement, the Navy said there are talks going on among various parties attached to the project. In addition, the statement said there are legislations and environmental studies that are ongoing before the final plan is finalized. Retired Rear Adm. Samuel Cox, director of the Naval History and Heritage Command at the Navy Yard confirmed that the talks are at an advanced and sensitive stage. In addition to the available funding, the Navy is also seeking a a nonprofit fundraising partner to help raise the money. Construction of the new museum will be coordinated by the Heritage Command.  The new museum will join the National Museum of the U.S. Army, in Fort Belvoir which is expected to be launched on Veterans Day.
