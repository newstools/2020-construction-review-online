Disneyland announced recently that they would be constructing one of the largest solar projects in Europe. Construction began at the site in July of 2020 and is expected to be completed in about 3 years. The first milestone for the first phase will be completed in the spring of, which is around April 2021. The plant will also have a touch of ‘Disney Magic’ once the project is completed as one section will be illuminated at night in the shape of Mickey Mouse, which will be visible from the sky.

The project will cover 42 acres, the 67,500 solar panels will not only shade guests from sunlight, rain, and snow but also produce 31 GW-hours per year, hence contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by more than 750 tons of CO2 per year, and create enough renewable clean energy to power 17% of the resort equivalent to the annual energy consumption of a small city. Geothermal energy is already supplying electricity to the theme park, via a power station located at Villages Nature Paris. It transforms the heat and steam naturally present in the ground to cover the heating needs of Disney Parks and the Disneyland Hotel. The efforts at Disneyland Paris showed in this solar projects, along with the 270-acre, 50MW solar facility built at Walt Disney World last year, are important steps towards Disney’s long-term goals of attaining net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and zero waste while conserving water resources and reversing the decline of wildlife. “Innovation and preservation of the environment are part of the heritage transmitted by Walt Disney and this ambitious project which uses solar energy illustrates Disneyland Paris’ commitment to the subject,” said Natacha Rafalski, president of Disneyland Paris. “As a company and a leader in tourism, we must focus on the sustainable development of our destination and its surroundings by opting for eco-responsible practices.”
