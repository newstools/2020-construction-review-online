Huffines Communities intends to construct 3,900 homes on a 1,424 piece of land which will make it the largest Master-Planned Community In Mesquite, Texas. The Solterra development will be the largest master-planned community in the city’s history. The developer has already secured the approval of a zoning change from the Mesquite, Texas, City Council. The project will be constructed at Lucas Farms with the Solterra community tasked to restore and protect the orchards, pecan groves, and pasture areas. The project will include housing units ranging between 1,200 sqr ft and 6,000 sqr ft and will sell at between $400,000 and $280,000. Huffines Communities will pay more than $1.6 billion in community tax for the project upon completion. “This is one of the biggest projects we’ve done, and we’re thrilled to make this a wonderful place to live and play as the home building market continues to sizzle,” said Donald Huffines, co-owner at Huffines Communities. The project has been designed with several community amenities including a full resort-style pool complex with a kids’ pool with a splash pad, lap pool, an adult pool, a pool with slides. There are several miles of hiking and biking trails and a large sand beach with access to the lake. In addition, the complex will have community gathering rooms, a coffee shop, a fitness facility with state-of-the-art equipment, and offices with covered balconies. Phase 1 of the project is expected to be complete by spring 2022 and will include between 650 and 750 units. In a comment on the project, Cliff Keheley, the Mesquite city manager said Huffines Communities have a reputation of developing structures with unique styles and Solterra will not be different. He noted that it is a milestone to finally see the project take off adding at more than 40% of the area will be designated for open spaces. This will include trails and usable open spaces within a quarter-mile of every Solterra home.
