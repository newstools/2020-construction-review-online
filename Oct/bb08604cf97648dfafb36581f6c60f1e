Construction of US $1.5bn Hub RTP mixed-use scheme in North Carolina, US has begun. The 44-acre development at the intersection of Davis Drive and I-40 will include two million square feet of office, residential, retail and hotel space, as well as 14 acres of green space, where an existing storm water creek is being converted into an outdoor recreational feature that connects to the RTP trail system. Centrally located between Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill, Hub RTP offers a new opportunity to balance work, home and recreation for the 55,000 employees who currently commute to the Park from surrounding areas.

KDC, a leading developer of corporate build-to-suit campus projects for major companies is both leading the infrastructure for the project and developing up to 1 million square feet of Class-A office space at the site. Larry Wilson, KDC division president said that Hub RTP will enhance the already impressive roster of top-tier companies within Research Triangle Park. With thoughtfully designed, sustainable buildings surrounded by naturally preserved greenspace, the mixed-use community will serve as a premier destination to attract and retain top talent. “With extreme flexibility to accommodate any sized user in the office and life science market, KDC is grateful for the partnership with the Research Triangle Foundation on this transformative project,” he added.
