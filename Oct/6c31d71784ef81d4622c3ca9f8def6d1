Yobe State government, led by Governor Maimala Buni, has flagged off the construction works of the 16-kilometer Nguru-Bulanguwa road. The states’ boss explained that the contract for the project whose value is over US$ 5M was awarded to Messrs Faris Construction Company Nigeria Ltd. This he said was after the latter met all the necessary requirements for the implementation of the project. Set to be complete within a period of 12 months, the project is said to be aimed at facilitating easy movement of goods and services, as well as to enhance farming activities in the local communities and to promote commerce among the border communities along the Nigeria and Niger borders.

On the sidelines of the commissioning of the Nguru-Bulanguwa road project, the  Yobe State governor also launched the construction of a 3.2-kilometer Nguru township road network and corresponding drainage system. The contract for this project, governor Buni said that it was awarded to Mother Cat Nigeria Limited and it is valued at a total cost of not less than US$ 2.2M. He explained that this road project will enhance the free movement of goods and services within Nguru town and further spur socio-economic growth of the town while the drainage system will help in curbing the perennial floods suffered by the town every year, especially during the rainy season. “I would therefore like to call upon the people of this region to support and cooperate with the construction firms handling these projects so as to ensure a timely delivery for our own benefits,” he concluded.
