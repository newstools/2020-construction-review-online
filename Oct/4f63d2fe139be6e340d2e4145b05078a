The government of Nigeria’s Kano state has set aside over US$6M for the proposed Dala Inland Dry Port project which is a logistics park located at Zawachiki in Kumbotso LGA of Kano State. The funds will be used for the construction of key support infrastructures such as access roads, electricity, water, and perimeter fence ahead of the actual implementation of the project. According to Mr. Hassan Bello the Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC), the government has already awarded contracts for the infrastructure development. Bello also mentioned that the project has gotten technical partners, a development, which is expected to fasten the pace of its implementation and insisted that the Kano dry port project is now on the front banner.

Speaking recently during his visit to the Nigerian Shippers’ Council Headquarters in Lagos State, the Governor of Kano State Dr. Abdullahi Ganduje, said that the port project was conceived with the aim to boost the Kano state’s economy and that of the Republic of Nigeria at large. In line with this objective, the Dala Inland Dry Port will serve the Kano State people and other states in the Northern part of Nigeria. Moreover, the port is expected to boost regional trade with other West African countries including the Republics of Niger and Chad as well as the northern part of Cameroon. Also, the port is set to capitalize on the rail infrastructure of the country, especially the rail from Kano to Jibia in Katsina, as well as the rail from Lagos to kano state, which will serve as the pedestal for the success of the operations of the Dry inland port.
