HS2 is a state-of-the-art, high-speed railway which is critical for the UK’s low carbon transport future. It will provide much-needed rail capacity across the country and is an integral part of the rail projects linking the North and South – helping to rebalance and strengthen the UK economy. HS2 will pass through 8 of the 10 largest Cities in the United Kingdom and is the largest infrastructure project in Europe. There will be 32 miles of tunnels, over 10 miles of viaducts, and Best of all, it will also be the largest environmental project in the UK, preserving and investing in nature along the way. Equipment Contracts for Phase One has been Signed: So far, 3 x custom-built, state of the art, MEKA Batching Plants have been ordered for the first stage of HS2 and we take extreme pride in being selected for the most prestigious project of our time. Being able to engineer and manufacture the complete project in-house has allowed us to serve the quality and reliability expectations of our customers. The bidding process for HS2 was long and cumbersome and our production facilities, previous references, and technical details; were all dissected in great detail. We have also competed against many respected global manufacturers, however, the Berkshire Engineering and MEKA solution was chosen as the preferred option, for which we are extremely proud. A Custom Solution Tailored to Project; The design process of most infrastructure projects dates back many years before the initiation of any RFQs for equipment. HS2 officially started back in 2009 and the equipment had to comply with a long list of pre-requisites. These pre-requisites stemmed from a long list of conditions, which included; environmental impact reports, local community requests, transportation of raw materials and concrete and the requirement to produce a variety of specialty concretes for different sections of the project and MEKA and BES were able to offer a solution that best meet their requirements.
