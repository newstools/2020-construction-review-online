Lake Victoria Water and Sanitation Project (LVWATSAN) in Kisumu County, Kenya, is set to receive a financial boost after the cabinet secretary for the National Treasury of Kenya, Ukur Yatani, signed an agreement with the Agence Française de Développement (AFD), the European Investment Bank (EIB) and the European Union (EU), to finance the project. As per the agreements, the AFD and the EIB will provide US$ 23.4M and US$ 41M respectively as concession loans while the European Union will make available US$ 5.8M as a grant. The national government of Kenya will provide counterpart financing of US$ 11.7M. The signing of the agreements paves the way for the implementation of the project which will expand the water and sanitation distribution network in Kisumu, a port city on Lake Victoria and the third-largest city in the East African country. To be undertaken by the Lake Victoria South Water Works Development Agency, the project entails the expansion of distribution networks to include informal settlements and expansion of water supply to the satellite towns of Ahero and Maseno. The distribution networks will also be fitted with a component for water quality monitoring for Lake Victoria, meant to protect the shared regional water resource and ensure the water treatment process is more efficient.
