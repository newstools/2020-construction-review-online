The government of Tunisia has launched a call for tenders for the construction of solar power plants with a total capacity of 60MWp. According to the North African country Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mines, the solar power stations will be built each with a capacity of between 1 and 10 MWp. Independent power producers (IPP) interested in the project have until the 9th of February next year to submit their proposals. After the bidding process is over, the selected investors will develop the projects under the Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) model whereby they will finance, build, own, maintain and operate the projects for a set period of 20 years, during which they will sell the electricity generated from the solar power stations to the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company (Steg), in accordance the conditions and procedures set by the government for the implementation of projects, the production, and sale of electricity from renewable energy sources.
