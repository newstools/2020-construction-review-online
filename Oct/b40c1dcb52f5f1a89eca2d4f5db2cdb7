The construction of Marsabit Stadium has resumed after stalling for nearly three years. According to the county development implementation coordination committee (CDICC) which toured the site the work being done on the first phase of the project by the two contractors namely Arid Lands and Benisa Limited is impressive. The former was employed by the county government to construct the VIP pavilion at a cost of Sh78 million of which Sh46 million has already been paid. However, the company has faced hurdles, after the National Construction Authority (NCA) questioned the integrity of the work. On the other hand, Benisa limited which is a construction company of buildings (property development) roads, and dams (Waterworks) was employed by Sport Kenya on behalf of the national government to build public pavilions alongside putting up the main pitch to international standards at a contract cost of Sh295 million. Sports Kenya Director Gabriel Komora said that the company which has since been advanced Sh126 million is also tasked with establishing a certified athletics track and installing electrical and mechanical works.

The county development implementation coordination committee (CDICC) said that the project was far behind schedule and a special sub-committee with a fortnight schedule of sittings to oversee its progress was constituted and directed the contractors to complete the project by December this year. County commissioner Paul Rotich called for a joint approach in the implementation of the project to ensure that it is completed by the end of the current year as directed by the president. According to Arch. Odhiambo George, a consultant with Mruttu Salmann Associates who accompanied the CDICC during the site visit revealed that the project which has so far offered 270 skilled and unskilled jobs was expected to cost Sh1 billion.
