The government of Ghana represented by President Akufo-Addo has commissioned the 64-kilometer Kete Krachi – Dodiokope Road Project in Oti, one of the six regions created in the West African republic back in 2018. The project was undertaken in three phases by Messrs First Sky Limited, at a total cost of ¢156 million, and was funded by Cocobod, with the Ghana Highway Authority serving as the implementing agency and supervising consultant. The road in question traverses the Krachi West and Krachi Nchumuru Districts in Oti Region, and it serves communities like Kwaaku, Ntewusu Bomoden, Duakese, Gyato Chayo, Motoka 1 and 2, amongst others. It is expected to enhance the production of staples, fishing, trading, and the other economic activities in the three districts of Nchumuru, Krachi East and West, and will also serve as a major route for the transportation of yams from Oti and northern regions of the country to the south.
