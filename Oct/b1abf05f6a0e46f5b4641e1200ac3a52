The wave pool, 220 meters long and 240 meters wide, can produce waves of up to 2.4 meters every 8 seconds and accommodate a maximum of 150 surfers per hour, it said. Due to the new coronavirus pandemic, however, only the artificial wave pool will accept visitors for the time being. Those who wish to visit should make reservations at the website as the park will admit a limited number of people to keep social distance among visitors, the operator said. The park is part of a massive ocean leisure complex currently under construction by the Siheung city government, Gyeonggi provincial government, Korea Water Resources Corp., and Daewon Plus Construction Co. The rest of the complex, including an eco science park and a street of shops, is set to be completed by the end of 2025, according to the related authorities.
