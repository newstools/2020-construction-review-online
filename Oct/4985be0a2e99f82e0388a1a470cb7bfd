This is after the company was awarded the contract by the government of Zambia to undertake the over US $41m project. According to Fred Mulozi, regional coordinator for Western Chamber of Commerce and Industry, AVIC deserves the contract because it has proved its good workmanship in Zambia’s construction sector. “We are happy that government has awarded the construction of a water and sanitation supply system to AVIC International, the Chinese company has had a good number of projects in Zambia, this shows that the firm is able to deliver according to the expectation of the people,” he said.
