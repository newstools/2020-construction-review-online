According to Prof Hozen Mayaya, the IRDP Rector, the project is a part of a series of diverse strategies initiated by the state-owned institute to support the fifth phase government‘s efforts to industrialize the East African country, and also address poverty from the grassroots. He said that the institute in partnership with other key development partners, like European Union (EU) and international organizations like Unicef had also implemented useful projects for the construction of several industries in different parts of the country including a leather processing factory and sunflower oil plant in Dodoma. “Above and beyond boosting economic growth in the central zone corridor, the two factories play a key role in the improvement of service delivery and they create direct and indirect job opportunities to residents of the host communities,” elaborated the IRDP Rector.
