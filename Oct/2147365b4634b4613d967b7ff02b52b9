The Rutland Regional Medical Center has completed the construction of the new Thomas W Huebner Medical Office Building at a cost of $24 million. The new building offers much-needed space for health workers at the facility.  The Thomas W. Huebner Medical Office Building officially opened on Monday in a ribbon-cutting ceremony. The new 37,000 square-foot Thomas W Huebner Medical Office Building is connected to the main hospital and houses Vermont Orthopaedic Clinic, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and ENT and Audiology medical practices. Huebner was employed at the hospital in 1990 and rose in ranks to become its CEO in 1997, a role he served up to 2018. He still lives in town and is involved in the affairs of the hospital. In a statement, the hospital’s current CEO Claudio Fort said the Thomas W Huebner Medical Office Building project needed $24 million to complete as some the facility’s busiest practices lacked sufficient space. He added that the new space will give room for growth adding that its connection to the main hospital makes it easy for surgeons to easily monitor patients and respond to emergencies. “We were seeing patients in substandard space,” Fort said. “There wasn’t enough room for two wheelchairs to fit through the hallway and literally, patients had to go outside of the facility to go to the other part of the facility to go to the bathroom.” The Rutland Regional Medical Center was recently ranked among America’s 100 Best Hospitals for Joint Replacement. This is according to a report released by Healthgrades, a leading publication that connects physicians, consumers, and health systems. Healthgrades evaluates the performance of around 4,500 hospitals countrywide based on 32 of the most common inpatient procedures and conditions. It is the only hospital in Vermont to receive the award as well as the only hospital in Vermont to get the Healthgrades Joint Replacement Excellence Award™ for 3 consecutive years.
