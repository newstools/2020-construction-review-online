Jane Williams, this investment in California will improve public transportation and support economic recovery in the Bay Area. “This project will allow BART to operate additional trains through the Transbay Tube, helping to alleviate crowding and increase capacity in this critical corridor,” he said. He further added that the federal funding is an economic boost for the Bay Area as the project will create jobs and help communities recover from the COVID-19 public health emergency. FTA’s CIG program provides funding for major transit infrastructure projects nationwide. Projects accepted into the program must go through a multi-year, multi-step process according to requirements in law to be eligible for consideration to receive program funds. With this announcement, FTA has advanced funding for 40 new CIG projects throughout the nation under the current government since January 20, 2017, totaling approximately US $10.7bn in funding commitments.
