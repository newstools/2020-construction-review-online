Both plants will be operated by BioTherm Energy for a period of 20 years under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) signed between the Independent Power Producer (IPP) and Eskom, the state-owned electricity utility. According to the company statement, at the height of their construction, Aggeneys Solar and Konkoonsies II Solar power projects provided jobs to over 1,000 local workers from the rural towns of Aggeneys, Witbank, Pofadder, Pella, and Onseepkans, situated within the 50km radius of the plants. These are the same communities that will benefit from economic development programs through the 20-year operations period of the plants. The focus of the economic development initiatives will include education, skills development, and environmental stewardship among others.
