Jacobs, a construction and engineering giant has made a donation of $8 million towards the Klyde Warren Park expansion project. It is the company’s latest move to make a civic mark to its hometown, four years after moving its headquarters from Pasadena, California. The donation will go towards the expansion of the 1.6-acre Klyde Warren Park. Cumulatively, the park sits on 5 acres and was launched in 2012.  Construction of the park is expected to start in late 2021 and competed in 2024. The 36,000-square-foot multi-use west lawn of the project will be named The Jacobs Lawn in recognition of the company’s contribution. This space will offer an additional green environment and will be used to host a variety of open-air events like a winter ice rink, festivals, markets, and other forms of business and recreation for the community. In addition to the financial contribution, Jacobs took part in the original planning and design of Phase 1 of the project. Phase 1 was constructed over a major highway and is one of the first “deck parks” in the world. More than 300 concrete beams were used to construct the street-level deck over Woodall Rodgers Freeway. The beams are arranged with spaces between to allow for shifts during varying temperatures. There are concrete slabs in spaces connecting the bottoms of the beams which for trenches. These trenches are used as planter boxes where trees are planted and allowed to grow to desired heights. Geoform together with specially-designed soil has been used to keep the deck from being too heavy. Recently, a Sacramento, California-based contractor also acquired naming rights for a public arena it had helped to build. Roebbelen Contracting was granted naming rights for the Placer Valley Event Center, which is a section of the $47 million transformation of @the Grounds 55-acre fairgrounds in Roseville, California. the parties did not disclose the financial terms of the sponsorship.
