Dalasi Basse Market in Gambia is set to be rebuilt at a cost of US $1.4m after it was burnt down in February, 2020 by a mysterious fire break. Gigo construction and Gai enterprise have been contracted by Gamworks to rebuild the Basse market. Speaking at the handing over of the project to the contractors in Basse, Essa Conteh, Deputy Governor of the region told the people of Basse to take ownership of the market once construction work is completed. ” You should unite and coordinate among yourselves in order to see a successful implementation of this all-important project in their region,” he said. He further called on the contractors to do a good work for the people of Basse. “Give us the best. We want a standard market as you know Basse is the second capital of The Gambia. Reconstruction of the market is timely, and it will increase the volume of trade in the Basse and beyond,” he said.
