Eight months on, I am happy to commission the first of the power projects which has been completed, and that is the 6.5MW solar power project, here in Lawra,” said President Akufo-Addo. Constructed by Elecnor, a Spanish company that focuses on infrastructure, renewable energy, and new technology sectors, on a 6.13 hectares piece of land in the northern part of the Lawra township, the facility is provided with ancillary facilities such as a fully-equipped control room and a containerized substation as well as medium voltage switchgear and lines for transmitting power, PV lines, inverters, and transformers. The Lawra solar power plant is solely expected to supply electricity to some 15,000 households in the region in addition to helping increase the renewable energy component of the country’s energy mix and contribute to the fight against the effects of climate change. 13 MWp Kaleo solar power plant which is Lawra solar power plant sister project is currently under construction by Elecnor in collaboration with the Volta River Authority (VRA). VRA is the public body created by the Ghanaian government with the aim of developing, deploying, and sustainably using the resources of the Volta River and other renewable energy sources found in the river basin. Work on the Kaleo solar power plant is expected to be completed by December this year. The two projects are funded by Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW), the German development agency, to the tune of US$ 25M.
