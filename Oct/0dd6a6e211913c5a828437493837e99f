Gilbane Development has announced the start of the construction of Tempo, a 978-bed student housing project at the University of Maryland (UMD) in College Park, Maryland. The project is an eight-storey building that will comprise 296 units, 978 beds, and 300 indoor parking spaces. The student housing will be located at 8430 Baltimore Avenue and will sit on a 2.05-acre piece of land. It is strategically located 0.1 mile from the campus edge and just five-minute walk from the campus. The housing project is expected to house more than 42% of the university’s undergraduate students. The project has been designed with several features to support the student population. These include dedicated rideshare pick-up and drop-off spaces that will be situated next to a covered pocket park. In addition, there will be parking stalls for bikes and scooters. Tempo will be the first project to offer five-bedroom units to students in Chicago. The project will feature private bedrooms with en suit bathrooms and keyed entry, stainless steel appliances, in-unit washer/dryers, walk-in closets (in select units), high-speed internet (wired and wireless), granite counters, and a flat-screen TV. In a comment on the project, Gilbane Development Company senior vice president Russell Broderick indicated that the company is indeed privileged to be undertaking the project. “We are thrilled to bring this exciting new student community to College Park and The University of Maryland,” he said. He added that the housing project will offer students a superior community to live, learn, and prosper thanks to its unique design, unrivaled amenities, and walkable location. Broderick said in addition to Tempo, the company is also developing other local projects in the College Park and Prince George’s County community. The company has invested more than $350 million in the development. Tempo is expected to be completed and be ready for students in late 2022.
