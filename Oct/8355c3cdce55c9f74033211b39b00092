A state-of-the-art gypsum wallboard production facility is set to be built near Sweetwater, Texas, US. The new US $285m plant will be Georgia Pacific’s second gypsum wallboard facility in Nolan County. The new facility will be located adjacent to GP’s existing gypsum plant, on Highway1856, off Interstate 20, and will incorporate state-of-the-art production processes. The two operations combined will be capable of supplying customers and distribution partners with more than 1 billion square feet of gypsum products each year. Currently, Georgia Pacific is preparing the site to build the technologically advanced plant, and construction on the new facility will begin immediately with startup expected in late 2022. Once it is operational, the new plant will employ approximately 120 full-time employees. With additional planned investments in its gypsum portfolio, along with the new Nolan County project, the company anticipates retiring its Quanah,Texas, facility in the next few years depending upon future market conditions.

He further added that Nolan County was chosen for the new project due to its proximity to gypsum customers. “In Sweetwater, we will be able to keep logistical costs low, and we will have access to more trucks to deliver our products. This, along with the company’s current gypsum facility near Sweetwater, a talented workforce and local natural resources, makes Nolan County an ideal site to expand our operations,” affirmed Paugh.
