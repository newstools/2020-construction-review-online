A planning team for a $100m Love Beach condominium project has expressed optimism that the project could pick up after contentious issues in the original design were addressed.  In an update, Sean Mathews, of N & M Architects said the latest design has omitted “over-water units” and the previous boutique hotel. The revised plan is expected to be discussed in a public hearing on November 12. Mathews added that having removed most of the things that were contested in the first design they hope the latest edition will be approved. Still, one of the people who opposed the original plan has already voiced concerns about the latest version. Dr. Gloria Ageeb said the development is likely to affect the tranquility of the neighborhood. In addition, she said the project will block some roads that have been used for long to access the beach. In an August 24 letter addressed to Adrian White, the Town Planning Committee’s chair, Mr. Matthews said there were not restrictions applicable to the proposed site on which the 121 new condominium units are to be constructed. The project is being developed by Mylor Caribbean Development. The construction of Love Beach condominium project is expected to create 309 construction jobs with $38.59 million paid out in wages over a period of three years. According to Mr. Matthews, the project will offer the much-needed boost to recover the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic. In the letter to Mr. White, Mr. Matthews said, “With our economy in ruins the need for foreign direct investment and job creation has never been more great.”  He added that it is this boost to the economy that prompted the contractor to revive the project. Mr. Mathews, job creation will be a very important determinant in the recovery of the economy after the pandemic. He added that the construction industry will play a key role in the recovery of the economy.
