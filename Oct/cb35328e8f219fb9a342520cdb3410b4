Over 1,000 houses including social amenities such as a clinic, community hall, sports pavilion, library, churches and schools are set to be built in Hwange, Zimbabwe. Local companies, which were allocated residential stands by the Hwange Local Board (HLB) at Empumalanga Phase 7 have stepped up efforts to soon commence construction. Some of the companies that were allocated land by the local authority include the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCO), FBC Bank, Zambezi Gas, South Mining Private Ltd and OK Zimbabwe. According to HLB, the board did not want individuals to get land at Empumalanga phase 7. It wanted to work with corporates because it would be manageable that way; especially when it comes to coordinating servicing of stands. This is because it normally becomes a challenge to have to have one part having topography while others donâ€™t because these projects are linked.
