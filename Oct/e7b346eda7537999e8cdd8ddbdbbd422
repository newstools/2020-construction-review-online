The government of Uganda through the Uganda Free Zone Authority (UFZA), has commenced the construction of the first Public Free Zone in the East African country. The project will be implemented by the National Enterprise Corporation (NEC), the commercial arm of the Uganda People’s Defence Force (UPDF), on a five acres piece of land acquired from the Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA) at the Entebbe International Airport premises. The Zone development is projected to cost about US$ 12.9M, 26% of which the Government of Uganda (GoU) has already allocated for the first phase of the project to kickoff. Upon completion, the public Free Zone will house seven production units and a Trade house that will host offices of UFZA, Uganda Revenue Authority (URA,) and other Government offices to facilitate a smooth flow of business in the Zone.
