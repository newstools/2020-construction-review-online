EPS will access HES Gornja Drina after the decisions of the Supervisory Board and the Government Serbia and, based on the investment it will make, it should acquire a 50-60% stake. The beginning of the construction of the HPP Buk Bjela has been announced for January 2021, whereas, for the other two HPPs, the beginning of the construction is scheduled for 2023. Other such projects are in the pipeline in the area, for instance, the 35 MW Sutjeska hydropower plant. They have caused an uproar among environmentalists, who are pointing to the potential devastation of nature and habitats and insist there were breaches in the licensing procedure.
