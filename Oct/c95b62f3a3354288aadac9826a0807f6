The feasibility study ahead of the implementation of the Buhinga and Akii-Bua stadium projects in Uganda are set to begin after the government of the East African country through the Ministry of Education and Sports released sh984m to cater for the exercise. The exercise will be carried out by two local consultancy firms namely Infrastructure Cost and Management Consultancy Limited and Habitat Consultancy on land in Lira, a city in the Northern Region of Uganda, and Kabalore, a district in the Western region of the country. In addition to detailed feasibility studies, the two consultancy firms will also undertake the concept design and environmental/social impact assessment for the projects.

The two firms are expected to deliver their findings within a period not exceeding three months, to help determine the cost of the actual construction of the two projects which will be funded through a grant from the People’s Republic of China. Hamson Obua, the Minister of State for Sports urged the two firms to ensure that they complete the work in the stipulated time otherwise, there would be consequences. “Any extension will be at a cost, and we shall go-ahead to recover the advance payment guarantee, recover performance and security costs and compel you to pay damages,” he elaborated. The Akii-Bua stadium is a part of the Lango Agenda for Development request that the people of Lango presented to President Museveni in 2012 and the two projects at large are a manifestation towards realizing the aspirations in terms of reviving, rejuvenating and revamping sports infrastructure in Uganda under the dreams and aspirations of the East African country president and the NRM government according to the minister of sports.
