Commenting on the order, Muhamed Bou-Zeid, the General Manager of Vestas Middle East and North Africa (MENA) said that they are proud to be back in Egypt and to continue their work to help transform the country’s energy infrastructure into a reliable system of clean power supply. “Our wide portfolio of solutions and services can help NREA ensure price stability and security of energy supply over time, and in turn, demand less reliance on fossil-fuel-based energy sources” explained Bou-Zeid. When fully operational in 2023, the project’s annual production capacity is expected to reach 1027 GWh of clean energy and according to NREA save around 560,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions within the same timeframe. It will be jointly financed by the European Investment Bank, KfW, Agence Française de Développement, and the European Commission.
