Located in the serene neighborhood of Lavington, along Othaya Road, Alkira Residences is an upscale 8-storey residential development surrounded by prestigious schools, hospitals, malls, sports & leisure clubs, and some of Nairobi’s finest international cuisine restaurants. It offers an exquisite Penthouse on the 8th floor that embraces an open plan for a range of uses. The proposed design consists of living and dining areas, a casual lounge, and an enclosed study area. The focal point of the penthouse is the expansive terrace that captures a 90-degree view of the Nairobi skyline.

They feature a laundry area and pantry, spacious living area opening to a spacious balcony, compact dining area, open baths with frosted glass for privacy and stand-alone vanities, extra cloakroom for visitors, lavish balconies (some of which run for 90 degrees) offering a great way of spending time outdoors without leaving the house, and stain-free wood-like floor tiles.
