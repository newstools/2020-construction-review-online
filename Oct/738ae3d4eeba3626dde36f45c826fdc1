The project is financed by the United States Really Epic Dog (RED) which is a global group of companies operating in media, sport, and entertainment promoting innovation, adventure, and positivity. It has been designed by Dean Jay Architects, a Durban based, and design-led practice. Speaking on the design of the establishment, Dean Jay, the CEO of the architect firm said that the Homestead site evokes a unique spirit of place with the juxtaposition of the existing historical ruins, the lake, and escarpment to create a powerfully understated lodge built from endemic ironstone that will harmonies with the landscape. On the other hand, Benjamin Smith, the president of the Really Epic Dog Group said that as a group of companies, they have a longstanding and deep-held passion for the Southern Africa country. “We want to instill that belief and hope in others as we recover from the unprecedented time we have all had to deal with, by offering our guests a place to reset and reconnect with themselves. First and foremost through experiences that help them reach a sense of understanding and peace with the world, as well as inheriting our love for South Africa” explained Mr. Smith. The project is set to be completed in the last quarter of 2021.
