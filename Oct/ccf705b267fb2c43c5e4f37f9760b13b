The government of Uganda through the ministry of Energy and Minerals development is set to construct the first Lake Victoria power submarine cable to evacuate electricity from the Masaka District (mainland) to Bugala Island through Bukakata. The Lake Victoria power submarine cable project will be implemented by the CCC Engineering LTD, a subsidiary of the Engineering Department of China National Electric Wire & Cable Imp./Exp. Corporation under the supervision of the Rural Electrification Agency of Uganda (REA). The scope of the work covers surveying, structural spotting, line route profiling, and pegging, procurement, delivery to site, and laying on the floor of Lake Victoria a 33-kilovolt seven-kilometer submarine cable and two 33 kilovolt switching sub-stations in Bukakata and Bugoma, and 27 distribution transformers.

Funding for the project The African Development Bank is financing the project under the Uganda Rural Electricity Access Project to expand grid medium voltage and low voltage distribution networks spread over five service territories in 16 districts to provide last-mile connections to consumers. The submarine cable will complement the 1.6 megawatts (per hour) solar power plant operated by the Kalangala Infrastructure Services, a Public-Private Partnership between government and private infrastructure development venture, namely InfraCo Africa. Patricia Litho, the cooperate communication and community affairs officer in Rural Electrification Agency says, the project is not to compete with Kalangala Infrastructure Services but rather to extend reliable services towards the Kalangala community.
