Is using old methods the easy way out? Old methods feel comfortable and safer, save you hours of research, and appear to be cheaper on your budget. After using the method for years, you know the ins and the outs of the procedure and have a solution for its problems. Or are those tried and tested processes starting to cost you money? As jobs become more complex and bidding more competitive, could your unwillingness to discard outdated practices be harming your company’s growth? A simple way of keeping up with new and complex projects is to embrace the change you’ve been resisting and look for new methods or equipment that help get the job done and will give your company’s chances to grow and expand your services. As did this company in Argentina, they had purchased a BF90.3 to recycle stones, they use to discard them. But by attaching an MB Crusher unit to their Hyundai they crush them and sell the products to others.  Their business is growing, a new revenue stream is coming in. Even when a working system that “has always worked” or “don’t require changing”, can benefit from embracing an operational change. By installing one of our BF90.3 to a Caterpillar 320 excavator, this small mining company in Perù found a way to invest in their company’s growth, while also saving their budget from unnecessary expenses. They use to sell the chalk as it was at a very low price, now they crush it with the MB mobile crusher and they have a high quality aggregate that is very valuable. Switching from an old method to a new one allow them make more money, whit a fast return of investment on the crusher purchase. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-113620" src="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/download-41-569x320.png" alt="" width="569" height="320" srcset="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/download-41-569x320.png 569w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/download-41-696x392.png 696w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/download-41.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 569px) 100vw, 569px" /> When, on a road construction project, the cost of purchasing the GSB fill material and using a truck to transport it isn’t cost-effective? The answer is find a new way to manage the excavated bedrock, by using a BF90.3, they crushed the bedrock down to an appropriate size and met the standards to use it as fill. Instead of using a method they’ve used several times in the past: using truck to dispose the excavated rocks and haul to the site the purchased GSB, a simple change such as using a MB mobile crusher on site had them producing their own supplies instead of paying to have someone haul the material away, they also acquired an attachment they can rely on for future projects. Our customers have started the switch from their old methods to new ones by looking at our range of attachments and purchasing the attachment that provides the most benefits, not only for their current job site, but for future projects as well.
