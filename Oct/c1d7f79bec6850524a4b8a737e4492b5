It is expected to be completed within a period of 30 months. The new Ouagadougou-Donsin international airport is under construction approximately 35 km northeast of Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. The first phase of the project whose commissioning was initially scheduled for June 2021, comprises a 3500m runway and a 17,000sqm terminal facility. The second phase, set for construction from 2026-2030, will expand the runway to 4000m and double the capacity of the passenger terminal. Upon completion, the facility will be managed by Meridiam, a global investor and asset manager based in Paris specialized in developing, financing, and managing long-term public infrastructure projects, under a 30-year concession.
