The first of which will produce approximately 2 MW of electricity will require an investment of, while the second phase with a projected capacity of 10 MW will cost US$ 20M. Phase one of the project which is estimated to cost about US$ 10M involves transmission line construction, transformer installation, grid connection, procurement and installation of electricity generators, and potentially the drilling of additional gas wells. The said transmission line will run from the Lesedi project to the town of Serowe, a distance of about 100 Km, where it will connect to the existing power grid. This phase will produce approximately 2 MW of electricity. The 2nd Phase mainly aims to increase the initial electricity production to 10MW and it will involve the drilling of more gas wells as well as the purchase of additional generators. The cost of this phase is approximately US$ 20M. Upon successful completion of phase one and two, the company plans to expand the project beyond 10MW. This expansion is expected to be completed using project revenues and debt.
