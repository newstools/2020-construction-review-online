Egypt’s Assiut governorate has been granted by the National Solid Waste Management Programme (NSWMP) over US$ 6.1M to improve its waste management system. This was announced by Yasmine Fouad, the Arab Republics’ ministers of the environment. The financial support he said will be directed towards the procurement of equipment such as self-pressuring trailers and loaders that will improve the collection and transportation of waste. The funds will also see the implementation of infrastructure projects such as the construction of four intermediate stations in Dayrout, Abu Tig, Abnoub, and Manfalut cities, as well as the construction of a waste recycling plant and a sanitary landfill site.

This he said has taken place through technical and equipment support for the Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) present in the governorate that collect waste. Meanwhile, a delegation of representatives from the NSWMP’s partners in the projects including the European Commission (EC), the German Development Cooperation Office (GIZ) GmbH, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC), and other European institutions visited Assiut to follow up on the program’s progress. On the sidelines of the visit, a foundation stone for the construction of two intermediate stations in Dayrout and Abu Tig was also laid. The capacity of each station is expected to reach 160 tonnes per day and is being implemented in cooperation with the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI), at a total cost of EGP 20m. With an estimated cost of over US$ 100M the NSWMP aims to develop the municipal solid waste system in the governorates of Kafr El-Sheikh, Gharbeya, Qena, and Assiut. 1
