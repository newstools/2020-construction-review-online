The construction work of the new Gbessia-Conakry international airport in Guinea has begun after the President of the West African Republic, Professor Alpha Condé, laid the foundation stone for the project. This comes following the signing of a 25-year concession contract with the Gbessia Airport Management Company (SOGEAG) for the development and financing of the project. SOGEAG is a company formed by the Republic of Guinea, Africa50, and Groupe ADP towards the implantation of the project. The share capital is broken down as follows: 34% held by the Republic of Guinea, 33% by Africa50, and 33% by Groupe ADP. Groupe ADP brings on the table its expertise in the field of airport operations and Africa50, a Pan-African infrastructure investment platform, will bring its expertise in the development and financing of projects and will oversee the relationship between the private investors and the Guinean government which will focus on defining and monitoring compliance with the objectives. The project covers the construction and operation of a new terminal for domestic and international passengers and the associated infrastructure. This includes a new cargo terminal, a parking area, and the renovation and extension of the runway and main taxiways. The new terminal upon completion will have the capacity to accommodate over one million passengers per year, in order to meet the traffic forecasts for 2031 while the airport cargo handling capacity will be quadrupled thanks to the new cargo terminal.
