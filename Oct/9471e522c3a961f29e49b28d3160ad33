MACFAB have supplied equipment globally over the last 30 years in different forms and sizes to suit customers specific requirements. Most recently MACFAB have installed 100mm x 65mm Lintel Profile in the Republic of Ireland, this system consists of the following spec; This customer produces varied length and sizes of lengths, on average they are producing 234 beams at 3metre long each day with this system. They have a range of lintels from 100 x 65mm through to 214 x 140mm. With each system we would bring the customer through the design process and they would be brought through a sign off process to insure they are happy with what they are purchasing. Once this is done all parts are manufactured in the Rep of Ireland based facility. A install team would then follow the system out to fit and train the operator in use of the system.
