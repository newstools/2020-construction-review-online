A new terminal is set to be constructed at San Diego International Airport in US. A Turner-Flatiron joint venture has been awarded a contract worth US $2.265bn to build the new terminal. The 1.2 million-square-foot building with 30 gates will replace the existing 1960s era terminal. Construction which is set to begin in late 2021 once all environmental permits are issued, will take place in two stages to ensure that the current number of gates remain available during the build out. During the first phase, scheduled to open in first quarter of 2025, 19 new gates will be added. The next phase, scheduled to open in early 2027, will add 11 new gates. When work is complete, the airport will have a total of 62 gates.

The terminal will offer a range of sustainable and energy-efficient features. A series of airfield improvements, including new, redesigned taxiways, will help reduce aircraft taxiing times, resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions. An underground fuel-delivery system will reduce the need for trucks to deliver fuel to aircrafts and result in less emissions and quicker turnarounds at the gates. The Turner-Flatiron team has completed previous work together at San Diego International Airport and at airports in San Francisco, Oakland, Sacramento and Denver. The team brings together Flatiron’s experience in airside construction as well as runway and taxiway operations with Turner’s experience in airport terminal and concourse commercial structures.
