Floor Storage This is the easiest way to store items. Stack them on the floor. This is the baseline storage. In many warehouses, you will find items laying on the floor. Some warehouses mount items between walls and posts. This saves on costs because usually the items are just placed on the floor. The only costs that may be incurred are signs to label the items. You might also need floor mats. Other than costs, you can easily see the items on the floor and get them by hand. But the disadvantage of storing on the floor is organizing the items. You cannot stack so many items on top of each other. They might fall off. You need a big space or flooring to put all your items. Hence, storing on the floor is not a space-saving solution. Also, storing on the floor is not a very good sight though to see. It can be messy when you get things. If there is a lot of movement, the items can fall off easily. They can land on the person getting the stocks. It is not that safe. It can endanger your employees as it can pose safety hazards. You cannot use the floor storage for fast-moving items. Floor storage, if not properly managed, can damage the inventory. For floor storage, you can use a hoist. But you cannot use a forklift. Most often than not, you get things by hand. Hence, while storing items on the floor does not entail high costs, it’s still not the best option. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-113344" src="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-512x320.png" alt="" width="512" height="320" srcset="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-512x320.png 512w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1023x640.png 1023w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-768x480.png 768w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-696x435.png 696w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-1068x668.png 1068w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1-672x420.png 672w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/image-1.png 1100w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /> Storing with Cantilever Racks When it comes to warehouse storage options stacking racks are a versatile option for storage.
