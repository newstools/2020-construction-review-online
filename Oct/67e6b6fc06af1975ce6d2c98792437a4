The residential units include more than 900 on-site income-restricted units, and an additional US $5m housing stabilization fund to support off-site income-restricted housing, bringing the total commitment of affordable housing to 20% of the overall units. At least 10% of the total residential units will be set-aside for senior housing. In addition, the commercial portion of the project will contribute US $28m in linkage funding to the Neighborhood Housing Trust to support the creation of affordable housing.
