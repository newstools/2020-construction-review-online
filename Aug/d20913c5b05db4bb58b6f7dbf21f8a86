Chisholm Grid batteryÂ energy storage system, the largest standalone battery energy storage project in the United States has begun construction. Located in Texas, The Chisholm Grid will have an initial rated capacity of 100 MW and is scheduled to begin commercial operations by mid-2021. Developed by Able Grid Infrastructure Holdings, The Chisholm Grid battery energy storage system was a joint venture between Able Grid and MAP. Able Grid agreed to supply construction management and operational asset management services for the site. In early August, Astral Electricity issued full notice to proceed to Mortenson and work has already begun on site for the balance of plant and high voltage transmission components, making Chisholm Grid the largest standalone battery energy storage project currently under construction in America. At peak construction, approximately 50 people will be employed on-site at Chisholm Grid, and Mortenson has secured subcontracts from local Dallas, Fort Worth-based trade partners to ensure local participation on the project. Chisholm Grid is fully owned by Astral Electricity, a privately-held energy storage power producer who develop low-cost energy storage assets that provide reliable, emissions-free capacity to manage the physical and financial volatility of energy markets.
