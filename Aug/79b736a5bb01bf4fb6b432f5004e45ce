The government of the Republic of Ghana under the leadership of President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has cut the sod for the construction of a new Water Supply system in Yendi, a town and the capital of Yendi Municipal district in the Northern Region of the West African country. Speaking during the sod-cutting ceremony, President Akufo-Addo said that the current Yendi drinking water supply system was built back in 1941 and it has never undergone any rehabilitation works ever since then.

Furthermore, considering the significant increase in population and economic growth, it has become necessary to construct a new water supply system so as to meet the water demands of Yendi and its adjoining towns and communities” explained the Ghanaian president. The project is being financed by the India Exim Bank under a US$ 30M loan facility. The latter entered into the financial agreement with the government of the Republic of Ghana recently after approximately 24 months of negotiations. The contract for the implementation of the project has been awarded to WAPCOS Limited (initially known as Water and Power Consultancy Services Limited), an Indian provider of integrated and customized solutions for the sustainable development of water, electricity and infrastructure projects, operating under the Ministry of Jal Shakti of the Government of the Republic of India. The aim of the project is to provide the people of the Yendi Municipality and its environs i.e (Ghani also known as Ngani, Sambu, Adobo, Sokoli, Nakpachei, Gbungbalaga, and Kuga) with 5,000 cubic meters of water per day, at least for the next 20 years.
