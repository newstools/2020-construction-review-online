Department of Transportation (DOTr) in the Philippines has awarded two civil works contracts, worth around US $728m in total, for the $6.1bn Malolos–Clark Railway Project. The Project involves the construction of 53.1km-long railway line connecting Malolos to Clark economic zone and Clark International Airport (CIA) in central Luzon, Philippines. DOTr awarded the first contract to the Acciona Construction Philippines and EEI Corporation joint venture (JV) for the construction of 6.3km-long main railway lines and 1.6km of the depot access line. The scope of the contract also includes the construction of an underground railway station at Clark International Airport.

The DOTr is expected to award three more civil works contracts later this year. Scheduled for completion by 2024, the Malolos–Clark Railway Project project aims to ease road congestion while reducing annual traffic-related economic costs. In addition to creating about 24,000 local construction jobs in the next three years, the project will create 14,000 jobs once operational. Furthermore, the project will also cut the travel time between Clark and Manila from two to three hours by bus to one hour by train, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60,000 tons a year. The railway project, which secured a US $1.3bn loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) last year, forms part of the 163km North-South Commuter Railway Project.
