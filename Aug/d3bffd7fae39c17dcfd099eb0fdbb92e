Singapore has began the construction of one of the world’s largest inland floating PV (photovoltaic) solar systems that is expected to be built on the Tengeh Reservoir. The PV system is going to be 60 MW and is also one of the first in the world to integrate green technology with water treatment. The PUB (Public Utilities Board) National Water Agency of Singapore gave an announcement recently that, Sembcorp Industries, one of its subsidiaries had begun construction on the world’s largest inland peak floating solar PV system on Tengeh Reservoir, on Singapore’s northern border with Malaysia. The 60MW floating solar plant will be integrated with PUB’s water treatment plants. It is expected to be completed and operational by 2021 and will generate enough clean energy sufficient to power PUB’s local water treatment plants, offsetting around 6% of its annual energy needs.

The agreement to supply power to its own water treatment operations was made in May of 2020 when Sembcorp announced that it had signed a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the power generated from one of the world’s largest inland floating PV system. Singapore is a sovereign island city state that has a total land are of 724.2 squared kilometres and is heavily populated thus it does not have a lot of room for traditional renewable energy generating technologies making solar energy the country’s most viable renewable energy source. However, even with large-scale deployment of solar panels is difficult due to its dense urban landscape and limited available land.
