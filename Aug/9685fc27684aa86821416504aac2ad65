It includes the construction of residential areas, seafront promenade as well as over 40 retail outlets. The design of the Le Carrousel project is inspired by Dutch artist M.C. Escher, whose work often includes paradoxical architectural designs of seemingly infinite loops. The development, other than refined residences within an exclusive private community, it features a 500-meter seafront promenade, a five-star hotel with 123 rooms and suites, and an open-air shopping mall with an area spanning 30,000m2, featuring 120 shops. The mall will be like no other in the North African country. The project is also designed to provide a unique 360-degree experience for both its residents and visitors with only 50% density and more than 30% of the development’s land reserved for green spaces. Le Carrousel is set to become one of the leading destinations in the republic of morocco and has become an integral part of the development of the Rabat Corniche. It is expected to create more than 1,100 job opportunities upon completion.
