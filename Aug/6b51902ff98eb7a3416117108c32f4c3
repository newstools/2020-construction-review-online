Now available from IPD South Africa, the IPD steel spacer place for the CAT 3500 series engines is more corrosion-resistant than the standard aluminium or cast iron product. This cost effective option is for CAT part number 5197297, which replaced part number 3629677. The IPD spacer plate includes several other beneficial changes such as a new MLS gasket shape, made to meet OEM thickness specifications. There is also an added, precision-machined O-ring to ensure proper sealing, and added grooves to aid in disassembly. Smooth corrective edges help to seal the surface between mating components. IPD has been lowering running costs for CAT owners since 1955, without compromising quality, performance or engine life. With its ISO 9001:2008 certification, the company ensures the highest quality of components, governed by stringent quality control processes. A robust product line makes IPD a leader in the aftermarket for these popular engines.
