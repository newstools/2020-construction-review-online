The Chairman of Gwagwalada Area Council, Alhaji Adamu Mustapha, has flagged off the construction of Anagada road in the council. According to Mr. Mustapha the 1.3km road would connect Anagada community to the Zuba-Lokoja Highway and it would be asphalted; with a drainage system on both sides. “Construction of the road is part of the Council’s administration efforts to provide viable infrastructure that would impact on the lives of residents of the council, especially the rural populace,” he said.
