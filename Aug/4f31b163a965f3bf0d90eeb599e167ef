The ongoing implementation of the Bumbobi-Manafwa-Lwakhakha road project in Uganda nears completion with its construction works currently standing at 92 percent. This was revealed by Eng. Titus Aleper the project manager from the Uganda National Roads Authority (UNRA). He affirmed that by September this year the works will be complete and the project handed over to begin operations by the start of the following month. On 26, September 2016 the UNRA signed a contract with China State Construction Engineering Ltd, a Chinese construction company, for the upgrade of the 44.5 km Mbale–Lwakhakha road with the consultancy services of SGI JV. The commencement order was issued in December the same year and the initial set duration for the project was 24 months, but UNRA approved EOT of 261 days which led to the extension of the completion date to September this year.
