Construction of Wildflower Ranch, a new master-planned community in North Texas, US has begun. The community will feature 3,300 single-family residences, a resort-inspired lazy river, trails, recreational spaces, a Northwest ISD school site and more — all spanning across 1,100 acres of idyllic native landscape. Adjacent to Highway 114 and US Interstate 35W, Wildflower Ranch is a family-focused master-planned community. The initial phase of the activated development will consist of 400 single-family residences by premier DFW homebuilders, Beazer Homes, Bloomfield Homes, Gehan Homes, Highland Homes and Lennar Homes. The natural-inspired vision for the Ranch features an expansive lazy river complete with shaded gathering areas and a lounging pool deck. Additional amenities include a series of trails, thoughtful programming for Harriet Creek, a community pavilion and gathering area as well as multiple playgrounds for all ages. Served by the celebrated Northwest ISD, future plans also feature a new site for the school district.
