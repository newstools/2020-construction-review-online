655 build-to-rent developments are set to be constructed in Leeds, UK by Galliford Try. The US $138.9m scheme is set to transform the south west of Leeds city centre, on the former Monk Bridge steelworks site, just off Whitehall Road. The significant development, is being constructed on behalf of Highline Investments, and will see the creation of five new blocks varying from 12 to 22 storeys in height. All the accommodation will be available as a private rental scheme and will include one, two and three-bed apartments. Bordering on to the Leeds-Liverpool canal, the new scheme makes the most of the existing surroundings, using the Victorian viaduct of the defunct Leeds and Thirsk railway to create a new plaza providing seamless entry to the city centre. The existing railway arches below will also be renovated to provide space for retail and hospitality businesses.
