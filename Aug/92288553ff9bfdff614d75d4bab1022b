Funded by the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) as part of its mandate to establish key oil and gas industry infrastructure and increase retention of industry spend, the feasibility study is expected to be complete roughly within a span of four months. Speaking during the project kick-off meeting, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, H.E Chief Timipre Sylva, said that the actual construction works will be undertaken by China Harbour Engineering Company, and it should be complete in six months’ time. The future shipyard is mainly meant to cater to the maintenance and repair services of cargo vessels, oil tankers, and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) carriers which are highly expected to increase with the completion of the implementation of the Nigeria LNG’s Train 7 project. “It is such a shame and loss that most of the vessels that operate in the oil and gas industry, mostly in our country, are taken to Ghana, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon and other countries for dry-docking because our local dry docks were built many years ago and no longer provide the required services,” stated the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources. He further affirmed that the project would create employment opportunities for Nigerians and help the country to increase retention of industry spends, as well as develop and harness the nation’s position in the oil and gas value chain and linkage to other sectors of the economy.
