The vice mayor in charge of Infrastructure Development Eng. Ernest Nsabimana has revealed that several steps towards the execution of the proposed aerial cable car system project in Kigali, Rwanda, have been made so far approximately two years since plans for the project were first made public. “Consultations between the Ministry of infrastructure, the ICT institutions, the Rwanda Development Board (RDB), and the project investors have been finalized where the relevancy of the project was approved. As we speak, discussions are ongoing for the construction of the Personal Rapid Transit (PRT) i.e. the special road for the cable cars, and they (discussions) are quite promising,” explained the vice mayor adding that, “If all goes well, and we trust it will, we will have the cable cars and the PRT systems operating in Kigali in two years’ time.” In the meantime, the capital city of the East African country is working around the clock on its transport infrastructure in order to offer smooth transport experience during the Commonwealth Heads of State and Government Meeting (CHOGM) which is scheduled to take place mid next year. Among the work being carried out is the widening of the municipality’s road network while creating 24-kilometer alternative roads which will continue to ease traffic congestion in the city, even after the CHOGM.
