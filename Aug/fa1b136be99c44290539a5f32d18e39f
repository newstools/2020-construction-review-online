The government of Mozambique has signed a security pact with Total to support the development of the US $20bn Mozambique LNG project amid an insurgency linked to Islamic State. According to the pact, a joint task force will ensure the security of Mozambique LNG project activities in the Afungi site, and across the broader area of project operations. Mozambique LNG will provide logistic support to the joint task force which will ensure human rights principles are respected. According to Ronan Bescond, country chair of Total in Mozambique, all parties involved in the project are committed to enabling steady progress towards a successful delivery of the project.

Construction works at the country’s first onshore liquefied natural gas development had been stalled due to a coronavirus outbreak and lockdown measures. The project is expected to produce its first LNG cargo by 2024, through a two-train liquefaction plant. The project includes the development of the Golfinho and Atum fields, located within Offshore Area 1 – which holds over 60 trillion cubic feet of gas resources.
