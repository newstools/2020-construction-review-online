LS Power has become the title holder for the world’s largest active battery storage despite it being a title that changes very frequently and was previously held by Tesla-supplied Hornsdale plant (150 megawatts/193.5 megawatt-hours). After the completion of the 250-MW Gateway project, LS Power’s Gateway project was dubbed the world’s largest active battery storage site however it currently sits at 230 MW of operations capacity, with the last 20 MW set to come by the end of August, 2020. Following the completion of the Gateway project, LS Power will be keeping the large-scale storage train rolling in the months and years to come. LS Power currently has plans in the works for the 200 MW Diablo Energy Storage facility in Pittsburg, California, the 125-MW LeConte Energy Storage facility in Calexico, California and the massive 316-MW Ravenswood Energy Storage project being developed in Queens, New York.

All of these facilities will come out near the top of the global leaderboard for largest energy storage projects upon their completion. Currently, California has a heat wave and, combined with the cutting down of power plant capacities the state has been doing recently, it has become more and more difficult to supply power for air-conditioning but the completion of this project has brought hope for more supply.
