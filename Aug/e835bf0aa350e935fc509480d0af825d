A consortium has been formed towards the implementation of the proposed 11,050 MW Inga III hydropower project on the Congo River in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The consortium is made up of six Chinese companies led by the China Three Gorges Corp, and AEE Power Holdings from Madrid, Spain. The above-mentioned companies together with Actividades de Construcción y Servicios (ACS) from Spain, which withdrew from the project due to alleged disagreements over the distribution of shares, were selected by ADPI-RDC, the Agency for the Development and Promotion of the Grand Inga site, in the Central African Country. Following the new agreement, the 6 Chinese companies in the consortium have a total 75% stake in the project while the Spanish company AEE Power Holdings has a 25% share. The latter will retain this shareholding in the future special purpose vehicle that will be set up to develop and ensure the financial mobilization for the realization of this project.

Upon completion, the Inga III hydropower project is expected to electrify Kinshasa, lead to the development of the DRC’s mining sector, and earning of foreign currency from exported power. A deal was struck with South Africa in 2013 to supply about 2.5GW of electricity through the SAPP power lines, and Nigeria and Angola in the western region of Africa are also expected to benefit from the project. It is also expected to contribute to the realization of the NEPAD objectives of increased power interconnections across Africa as well as help stabilize the political conditions in the African countries involved through cross-border cooperation in the continent and beyond.
