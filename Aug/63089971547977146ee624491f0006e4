The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) has awarded the US $70.5m contract for the reconstruction of Interstate 4 (I-4) at State Road 557 (SR 557) interchange in Central Florida to Skanska, a global construction and development firm. The design and reconstruction will transform the interchange from an existing partial cloverleaf interchange configuration to a diamond interchange. A new bridge will be constructed to carry SR 557 traffic over the newly widened I-4 to accommodate future tolled express lanes and a high-speed rail (HSR) corridor. The roadway project, designed by engineering firm DRMP, will be a major improvement to the traffic patterns and enhance motorist safety. Construction is projected to begin in September 2020 and completion is slated for summer 2023.
