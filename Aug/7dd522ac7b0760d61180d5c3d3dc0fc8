Construction of US $1.9bn Alpine Park in Toronto, Canada has begun. This is after Canada based real estate company Dream Unlimited broke ground on the mixed-use scheme in Distillery District. The move follows the award of the final construction contract by the province for the completion of the last phase of the Southwest Calgary Ring Road, which is said to be the pivotal access for the project. Dream Calgary Land division general manager Tara Steell said that with the upcoming opening of the Calgary Ring Road, Alpine Park is well located and easily accessible to the whole city.

He further added that Alpine Park is among some of their most prestigious mixed-use communities, along with The Distillery District and Canary District in Toronto and Zibi in Ottawa. “We strive to build communities that help make peoples’ lives better,” he affirmed. Expected to create 1,700 direct and indirect jobs per year, the mixed-use scheme would create more than 20,000 new jobs over the 15-year operational life of the project. The scheme is also expected to create 4,000 ongoing jobs throughout the commercial, retail, industrial and institutional areas that are integrated within the neighbourhood. Designed by HDR/Calthorpe and its partner architect Civitas, the first phase of the project includes the development of 120,000ft2 of retail space and 1,276 residential units. The Alpine Park’s founding builder partner group include Calbridge Homes, Cardel Homes, Genesis Builders, and Homes by Dream.
