The Netherlands has begun construction of the 322MW Windpark Zeewolde windfarm. This will be the largest onshore wind farm in the Netherlands and the largest community-owned wind farm in Europe and is headed by Mott MacDonald, the lenderâ€™s technical advisor on the project. The project is going to be located near the city of Almere and will involve the construction of 83 new Vestas turbines to replace more than 200 existing wind turbines in the same area. This will result in the generation of almost three times more energy with half the number of turbines. The project is expected to be completed by 2022 and equipment deliveries for the project are scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2021. Once online, the Windpark Zeewolde windfarm in the central Netherlands will be capable of producing electricity for more than 250,000 households. Its output is contracted under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall AB.
