The world’s largest green hydrogen facility is set to be constructed in the north west corner of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The US $5bn plant will supply 650 tons per day of carbon-free hydrogen for transportation globally and spare the world of 3 million tons of carbon dioxide every year. The joint venture project between Air Products Chemicals, ACWA Power and NEOM is the first partnership for NEOM with leading international and national partners in the renewable energy field and it will be a cornerstone for its strategy to become a major player in the global hydrogen market.

The project is scheduled to be operational in 2025. Air Products will be the exclusive off-taker of the green ammonia and intends to transport it around the world to be dissociated to produce green hydrogen for the transportation market. According to Seifi Ghasemi, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer for Air Products, harnessing the unique profile of NEOM’s sun and wind to convert water to hydrogen, this project will yield a totally clean source of energy on a massive scale and will save the world over 3 million tons of Carbon dioxide emissions annually and eliminate smog-forming emissions and other pollutants from the equivalent of over 700,000 cars. “We are therefore honored and proud to partner with ACWA Power and NEOM and use proven technologies to make the world’s dream of 100 percent green energy a reality,” he added.
