Structural works on the six-storey Parliament Building in Mount Hampden, Zimbabwe is now 100% complete; only internal and external endeavours to enhance the beauty of the structure and make it usable remain. Such works to do with electricity, water supplies, air conditioning and all that which makes habitation comfortable, are what they are working on now. Construction of the building whose concept was born in 1983 with the Kopje area in Harare as the proposed site, is being undertaken on a 6-hectare stand in Mount Hampden, about 20km from the City of Harare along Old Mazowe Road.

The building has common areas, offices, special services, general public and press areas, 800 parking bays, 50 of which are reserved for VVIPs, and associated services. The existing Parliament Building opposite Africa Unity Square was converted from a hotel that went broke in the 1890s, and was bought at bargain price by the British South Africa Companyâ€™s (BSAC) administrator. The space has since become inadequate for the current 350 legislators (including the Senate and National Assembly), and 248 secretariat staff, as it was meant for 100 representatives. An estimated 18 863 hectares have been set aside for the envisioned new city, three-tier site adjoining Mazowe and Zvimba rural district councils and the City of Harare.
