Construction of Alta Davis, a new luxury residential community in Durham, North Carolina has begun. This is after Wood Partners, a US-based real estate development company, broke ground on the project. Located minutes away from Research Triangle Park (RTP), a large research park, Alta Davis will be a conveniently located community with large apartments and abundant amenities. Upon completion, it will include 403 units across seven buildings, each with four floors. On-site amenities such as a coffee bar, game room, a fitness centre and saltwater swimming pool will also be included in addition to abundant co-working space. All the units will have access to elevators and will include high-quality finishes and amenities such as quartz counters, tile backsplash and hardwood-style flooring.

Construction is already underway and the residential community is expected to open in the second half of next year. According to Wood Partners managing director Caitlin Shelby, Wood Partners is excited about the opportunity to bring a residential community of the highest quality into this submarket, accommodating the growing number of new jobs in the region. “We know this community will provide residents with easy access to work while giving them a comfortable neighbourhood feel when they come home,” he said.
