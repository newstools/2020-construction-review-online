Construction of the Lily solar+storage project in Texas, US has begun. The project is Enel Greem Power‘s first hybrid project in North America that integrates a renewable energy plant with utility-scale battery storage. By pairing the two technologies, Enel can store energy generated by the renewable plants to be delivered when needed, such as to help smooth the supply of electricity to the grid or during periods of high electricity demand. In addition to the Lily solar+storage project, Enel plans to install approximately 1GW of battery storage capacity across its new and existing wind and solar projects in the United States over the next two years.

Lily’s 421,400 PV bifacial panels are expected to generate over 367GWh each year, which will be delivered to the grid and will charge the co-located battery, equivalent to avoiding the annual emission of over 242,000 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. The battery storage system is capable of storing up to 75MWh at a time to be dispatched when solar power generation is low, while also providing the grid access to a clean supply of electricity during periods of high demand. The Lily solar project was initiated and developed by Red River Renewable Energy, LLC, a joint venture among affiliates of Sun Chase Power and MAP® Energy, LLC.
