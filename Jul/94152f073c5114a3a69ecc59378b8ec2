The construction works of the second phase of the Tema Motorway Interchange project in Ghana is expected to commence next month but one, following an agreement signed between the governments of the West African country together with that of Japan. The agreement was particularly signed by the Ambassador of Japan to Ghana, Mr. Himeno Tsutomu, and the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration, Charles Owiredu. The latter lauded the Japanese government for its continued support to Ghana in different sectors including energy, agriculture, medical, and infrastructure, more importantly, road infrastructure. He acknowledged that through the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Japan is not only supporting the Tema Motorway Interchange project, but also the construction of a new bridge across the Volta River on the Eastern Corridor road.

The approximately US$ 1M project is a part of the government’s international corridor road improvement plan whose objective is to facilitate trade within the West African sub-region. Its main construction works involve the transformation of the parallel two-tier interchange into a three-tier interchange by a Japanese construction firm known as Messrs Shimizu Dai-Nippon. This is expected to hasten turnaround time at the interchange. The project is also, generally, expected to improve the capacity, safety, and efficiency of transport and freight on the Tema Motorway roundabout. The government of the Republic of Ghana is committed to improving the country’s road infrastructure. It has declared 2020 as the “Year of Roads”.
