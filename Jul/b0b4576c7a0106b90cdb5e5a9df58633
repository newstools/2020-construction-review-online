Each constituency received US $167,893. Oranjemund opted to use US $63,799 from the funds received to build the open market at Rosh Pinah because there was a demand for one from the mining town’s residents. The multi-purpose open market structure will accommodate 20 stalls and several open fire spaces for traders. It will accommodate salons, tailors, printing and internet cafes and space for food and fresh produce. The market, which is being built by a local contractor, would have been ready for trading had it not been for the nationwide lockdown as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
