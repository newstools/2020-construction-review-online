The government of Norway is providing a US $35m cofinancing grant for the installation and upgrading of power distribution networks in Province 2 and various substations to evacuate hydropower in Nepal. In addition, it is providing a US $5m technical assistance grant for capacity development of the Nepal Electricity Authority to ensure that gender equality and social inclusion are strengthened, and new technologies are used to make electricity infrastructure resilient. The project is aligned with the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation program on intraregional power trade through cross-border power exchange. The upgrading of substations in Khimti, Barhabise, and Lapsiphedi to 400 kilovolts will facilitate cross-border power exchange with India.
