The construction works on the proposed Koru-Soin multipurpose dam on River Nyando, approximately five kilometers upstream of Muhoroni town in Kisumu County, the western region of Kenya, is set to begin in September this year. This was announced by Mr. Erick Okeyo, the chairperson of the National Water Harvesting Storage Authority(NWCPC)  after a stakeholders’ meeting over the project. Mr. Okeyo said that tenders for the project have been closed for evaluation over the month of August after which the site will be handed over to the best bidder to start the work. So far the National Environment Management Authority(NEMA) has granted interim approval for the project and the NWHSA is currently working with the National Land Commission to ensure that project affected persons are compensated for the loss of their land. The project covers approximately 2,500 acres of land, equal to a total of 360 parcels of which 230 are in Kisumu county and 130 in Kericho county.

Upon completion, the project is expected to provide 102 000 m3/day of water to a population of 1.71 million and to end water shortages in the neighboring counties of Kericho, Nandi, and Kisumu. It will also act as a sediment trap, reducing sediment build-up downstream, which is the main cause of flooding and ensure regulation of the river flow, thus providing water for irrigation all year round. The reservoir will also offer opportunities in fishing and water-based tourism activities.
