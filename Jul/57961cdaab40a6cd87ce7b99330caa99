The Bagamoyo Port project is being implemented in Bagamoyo, Tanzania. It is expected to be one of the largest government infrastructure projects in the country. The Bagamoyo port and its affiliate industrial zone is meant to address congestion at the old port and support Tanzania to become East Africa’s leading shipping and logistics centers. Expected to be the largest port in East Africa, the US $10bn port is set to handle 20 million teu by 2045; that is 25 times the amount of cargo Dar es Salaam Port handles. The tri-government venture between Tanzania, China and Oman also involves the construction of a Special economic zone adjacent to the port. 190 industries including the manure processing industry that will be put up by the government of Oman will be constructed around the port. When fully developed, the Bagamoyo Special Economic Zone will attract about 700 industries. The project is backed by an Omani sovereign wealth fund.
