The government of the Republic of Ethiopia is set to construct a wastewater treatment plant with a capacity of 15 m³ (3,962 gallons/day) plant (STP) in one of the Ethiopian Water Development Commission buildings in Addis Ababa, the East African country capital city. The commission, which is a part of the Ethiopian Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy, has already signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the implementation of the project with the US-based Biopipe Global, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lifequest World Corp (LQWC) that developed the world’s only highly scalable onsite sludge and chemical-free sewage wastewater treatment technology. The small wastewater treatment plant is expected to serve as a reference site for decentralized wastewater treatment projects to be implemented by Biopipe Global in the country in the near future.

We have submitted several proposals over the last 3 months and expect to turn them into orders, once the Covid-19 situation improves,” said Tesfaye Tigabu Tedla. This project is expected to provide a significant and lasting improvement to the daily lives of Ethiopians just as in other countries such as the UAE and India where Biopipe solutions have proved to be the most sustainable, efficient, and cost-effective in the world.
