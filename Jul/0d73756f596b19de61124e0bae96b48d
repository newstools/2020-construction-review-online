SUEZ NWS and its partner will establish a new joint venture, to invest, build and operate Huaibei’s first integrated industrial hazardous waste management facility to provide services for companies in the area. Situated in the “New Coal Chemical Synthetic Material” industrial complex, the facility will rely on a treatment and Energy from Waste unit with a 30,000 tonnes annual capacity and a concrete landfill with the same capacity. The facility will be designed and built to EU emission standards. Its energy recovery system will recover and produce 85,000 tonnes of steam per year, which will be supplied to the industrial customers in the area while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the above-ground landfill, to be designed and built in accordance with China’s latest and most rigorous pollution control standards, will be used for landfilling non-incinerable hazardous waste.
