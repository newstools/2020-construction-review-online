Mass Transit Railway Corporation Limited (MTRCL) has awarded SNC-Lavalin‘s Atkins business in joint venture (JV) with Arup design consultancy contract for Tung Chung Line Extension in Hong Kong. The project involves a 1.3km underground extension of the Tung Chung Line to a new terminus station in Tung Chung West. An additional above ground station will also be provided between Sunny Bay and Tung Chung stations to serve the new development area in Tung Chung East on Lantau Island and strengthen the overall MTR network across Hong Kong.

According to Philip Hoare, President of SNC-Lavalin’s Atkins business, having worked alongside MTRCL for over 40 years, Hong Kong’s Mass Transit Railway is very much part of the company’s heritage in the region as they have grown alongside what is one of the world’s best metro systems. “We now look forward to utilising the very latest in digital design, engineering and modern methods of construction to develop a critical line extension which will serve communities across North Lantau,” he said. The Tung Chung Line extension to Tung Chung West and the new station at Tung Chung East will be constructed while the existing Tung Chung Line remains operational. Minimising any disruption for the rail service during the construction of the extension is a key challenge to the project. Sustainability of the design of the stations will also be a key area of focus while ensuring that they are fully integrated with the surrounding communities they are planned to serve. The project ground breaking is expected to commence in 2023.
