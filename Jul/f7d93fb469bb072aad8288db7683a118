Construction of a hydrogen train fuelling point is Bremervörde, Germany has begun. The station will serve a fleet of 14 Alstom Coradia iLint fuel cell multiple-units which Niedersachen transport authority LNVG has ordered for use by Eisenbahnen und Verkehrsbetriebe Elbe-Weser on passenger services between Cuxhaven, Bremerhaven, Bremervörde and Buxtehude from 2022. The hydrogen train fuelling point is going to be constructed by Linde, a gases and engineering company who has estimated the construction to be completed by mid-2021 to replace a mobile facility provided for the initial operation of two pre-series iLint units. The station will have a capacity of nearly 1,600 kg of hydrogen each day which will enable 14 units to be refuelled every day, providing a range of 1,000 km which is usually all that is required for a full day of operation. This innovation is supposed to provide future expansion to hydrogen to be produced on-site using electrolysis and regenerated electricity.
