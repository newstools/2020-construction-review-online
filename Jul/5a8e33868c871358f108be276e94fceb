Recently, the MD & CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, HE Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, took to visit the Hatta dam where a pumped storage hydropower station is currently under construction. The hydroelectric power station in Hatta is bound to be the first of its kind in the Gulf area. The Hatta dam will have a storage capacity of 1,500 MWh and a life span of 80 years, with investments totalling around US$387 million. According to a report, the tunnelling operations already began operating at the station and this is a key stage that uses the latest and safest drilling technologies to fit Hatta’s geological features while following the highest international environmental standards. The project is well in line with the UAE’s goals to secure a happy and sustainable future and make Dubai number one in all areas. The hydroelectric power station translates shows how hard DEWA, Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, has worked towards protecting natural resources whilst increasing clean and renewable energy.
