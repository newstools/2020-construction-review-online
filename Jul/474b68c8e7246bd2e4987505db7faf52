The president of Egypt, President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has been announced as the recipient of the 2020 Bababcar Ndiaye Greta Road Builder Award, presented by the African Development Bank (AfDB). The announcement came after a virtual inaugural meeting with the president and chairs of the African Development Bank early this week. President Al-Sisi was recognized for his “personal leadership” in the development and construction of various road projects, for example, the Heliopolis metro station in Cairo, as well as a suspension bridge project on the Nile, said the spokesman for the selection committee of the Africa Road Builders. The award presentation will take place during the final conference of the Africa Road Builders on the sidelines of the Annual Meetings of the AfDB which is organized every year on the sidelines of the Annual Meetings of the African Development Bank. The Gambian President, Adama Barrow, won the award in 2019 for his personal leadership skills shown during the construction of the Senegambia Bridge that links the Gambia to Senegal.
