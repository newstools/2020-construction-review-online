Alberta’s Ministry of Transportation has selected the consortium comprising VINCI and Graham to design and build the southern segment of West Calgary Ring Road in Canada. VINCI which is involved via Carmacks (a Eurovia subsidiary serving as lead contractor) and VINCI Construction Terrassement will cover 65% of the project while Graham will cover 35% of the project. This highway section will span 5km and include 4 interchanges, 7 bridges and a tunnel for pedestrians. The works encompass earthworks, drainage, paving and public lighting. The contract is worth US $209.2m. With this final section, the West Calgary Ring Road, located between Highway 8 and the Trans-Canada Highway, will provide over 100 km of free-flow travel around the city and on to the rest of the country by 2024. VINCI had opened the bypass around Regina, capital of the province of Saskatchewan, in October 2019. This new contract in Canada attests to the Group’s ability to support cities aiming to optimise road traffic with a view to fostering sustainable development in their regions.
