The government of the Republic of Ghana is set to construct new health facilities in Ashanti and Eastern regions following the approval of a €56,153,500 loan by the West African country legislative body for the implementation of the project. Provided by the Deutsche Bank AG, one of the world’s leading financial service providers, the loan will partly cater for the construction of trauma hospitals in Obuasi and Ayinam. Dr. Mark Assibey-Yeboah, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, said that the scope of work for the trauma hospitals include the construction works of features such as accident and emergency department, a male theatre, public health department, out-patient department, amongst others.

The projects are planned to be undertaken in a course of three years by local companies under engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractual basis. According to Dr. Assibey-Yeboah, the Anyinam region does not have a single major hospital and the existing Obuasi Health Centre is both ill-equipped and inadequate to meet the health needs of the growing population of the catchment area. Upon completion, the new health facilities he said will bring quality healthcare to the doorstep of residents of beneficiary communities and boost the healthcare sector of the entire country. The project is a part of the government’s commitment to the provision of universal health in line with the Sustainable Development Goal 3.
