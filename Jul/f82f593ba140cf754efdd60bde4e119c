The physical progress of the entire road works now stands at approximately 55.7% as compared to the planned 63-02%. CICO deputy head of the project Eng.

He urged the authority to fasten the compensation process so as to avoid any future complications. CICO’s Eng. Mao Jiawei affirmed that the company is committed to ensuring that the road works were completed on time and the road handed over within the contractual period despite the many challenges they are facing. The Hoima-Butiaba-Wanseeko road is one of the critical oil roads forming a major backbone to the infrastructure meant to facilitate oil exploration in the Albertine region as well as tourism due to proximity of high-interest areas such as Murchison Falls National Park.
