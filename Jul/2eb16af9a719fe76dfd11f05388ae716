An outline planning application for the Oxfordshire Garden Village to the north of Eynsham in West Oxfordshire, UK has been submitted by Grosvenor Britain & Ireland. The project has sought to adapt garden village principles for the 21st century – ensuring it will meet the community’s future economic and social needs, while paving the way for a substantial reduction in carbon emissions. The masterplan sets out provision for 2,200 homes, new primary and secondary schools, sports facilities, parks, allotments and 57,000 square metres of employment space. The new employment park is designed in particular to attract advanced manufacturing businesses. The site was one of 14 garden villages endorsed by the UK Government in 2017 to help meet the UK’s housing need. Grosvenor was appointed in the same year by local landowners to bring forward a planning application for an inclusive and sustainable scheme.

Local residents and front-line service providers have been closely involved in the design process through a series of events, exhibitions and study tours of other award-winning developments. A two-day interactive design workshop in May 2019 was attended by over 100 residents, community groups and stakeholders including Natural England, the Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission and local landowners. Oxfordshire Garden Village is the first new community outside London designed to act on the ambitious sustainability goals set last year by Grosvenor Britain & Ireland to address the climate emergency.
