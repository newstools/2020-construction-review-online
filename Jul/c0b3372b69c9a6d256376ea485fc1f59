The Suez Canal House is specifically located on an area of approximately 2,230 meters surrounded by canal waters from the north, south, and east. It was designed by a French architect and constructed by the Edmond Coignet concrete blocks company in the 1890s during the reign of Khedive Abbas Helmy II. The three-story main building with a basement is built in the shape of an Islamic style palace. This is evident by the three green domes covered in faience that rise above the building and the interior decoration of the ceilings, walls, the lanterns as well as decorations of the windows from the inside. According to the Port Said Archeological area director, the building has an attached rest house which was used to accommodate important visitors during the rule of Khedive Abbas Helmy II, for example, the King of England George V. The building was also used by the commander of the British forces participating in the tripartite aggression against Port Said back in 1956.
