The project also involves the construction of other processing units such as sulfur recovery unit (SRU), and sulfur solidification unit (SSU) as well as on-site and off-site storage areas and interconnecting utilities. Technip Energies is currently working with ANOPC to complete the remaining conditions precedent so that the construction work to commence. Upon completion, the approximately US $2.5bn hydrocracking complex will process about 2.5 million tonnes/year of heavy fuel oil (mazut) from ASORC’s nearby 4.5 million-tpy Assiut refinery to produce roughly 2.8 million tpy of Euro 5-quality diesel and other high-value products. This will contribute to the fulfillment of the needs of the Upper Egypt region in terms of petroleum products and at the same time reduce the volume of petroleum imports to the country. Alongside the Euro 5-quality diesel, the new hydrocracking complex also will produce 360,000-400,000 tpy of naphtha, 91,000-101,000 tpy of LPG, 331,000 tpy of coke and 57,000-66,400 tpy of sulfur.
