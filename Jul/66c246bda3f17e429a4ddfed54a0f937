The US $1.14bn plant is expected to be powered by JAC-class gas turbine supplied by Mitsubishi Heavy Power Systems (MHPS) and once constructed, it is claimed to use an efficient combined cycle technology in the region. The power plant will be located in the Qidfa area of the Emirate of Fujairah and will sit between the existing Fujairah F1 and Fujairah F2 water and electricity plants. Early power generation is expected to start by the summer of 2022, with full power generation beginning in 2023. According to TAQA generation executive director Farid Al Awlaqi, the Fujairah F3 project is a landmark for TAQA and its generation assets, following the company’s integration with ADPower. Apart from being the largest gas-fired power plant in the UAE, it will be one of the most efficient in the regions by virtue of utilising advanced combined cycle technologies. Funding for the power plant project is being provided by a consortium of international multi-lateral and commercial banks such as Japan Bank for International Cooperation, BNP Paribas, Mizuho Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Sumitomo Trust Bank and Standard Chartered Bank.
