US $135m new water treating facilities are set to be constructed for North Caspian Operating Company (NCOC) in Atyrau, Kazakhstan. Petrofac’s Engineering & Production Services (EPS) division, in joint venture with Isker, a Kazakhstan company, has secured the Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Pre-commissioning and Commissioning (EPCC) contract for the project. The work scope for the 30-month project includes an inlet stream screening to remove debris, feed water tanks with oil skimmer and pumps, a clarifier system including flocculation, coagulation and oil skimmer, treated wastewater storage and pumps, sludge treatment and relative utilities. The award of this project is in line with Petrofac EPS’s strategy to focus on and secure small greenfield and brownfield EPC projects, utilising its capabilities, footprint and infrastructure. NCOC acts as the operator of the North Caspian Project, the first major offshore oil and gas development in Kazakhstan. The company started oil production at the Kashagan field in 2016 and production has now reached 380,000 barrels per day.
