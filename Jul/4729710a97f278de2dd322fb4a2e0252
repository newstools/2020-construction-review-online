In China’s province of Hainan, the capital and most populous city, Haikou, has released official reports concerning the Meilan International Airport project saying that the second phase of the expansion project for the airport is set to be completed and commissioned by the end of 202. The Meilan International Airport is an important segment of the project for Hainan’s free trade port since most of the passenger and freight traffic falls on air transport. The second phase of the project comprised of the construction of new runways with a total length of 3.6 km and the construction of a second airport terminal with an area of ​296,000 square meters. Construction of the airport cost more than US$2.5 billion and is expected to increase the total number of passenger to and from the airport by 45 million per year and the volume of freight traffic by up to 600,000 tonnes. It is also expected to increase international passenger traffic from 8 million to 10 million people annually.
