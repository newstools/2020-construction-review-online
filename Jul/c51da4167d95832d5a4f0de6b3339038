The Lagos–Kano Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) line is a 2,700km railway line which will offer transport connections from the Port of Lagos to Kano, near the border with Niger. Below is the Lagos-Kano SGR project timeline and all you need to know about the project from beginning to the present date. After Nigeria obtained its independence from Great Britain, the railway lines that were built during the colonial era fell into a state disrepair. The government of Nigeria has since decided to do something about it. The government of Nigeria awarded China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) a US $8.3bn contract to construct a Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) from Lagos to Kano. However, due to funding problems for the entire project, the government decided to construct the railway in segments. Construction of the first segment from Abuja to Kaduna started. The 187km stretch which cost US $876m with Exim Bank of China providing US $500m and the government of Nigeria footing the balance, has since been officially inaugurated and is operational. The segment took almost 5 years to construct.

Ground-breaking ceremony for the second segment (Lagos-Ibadan) took place. Nigerian Minister of Transportation Rotimi Amaechi signed a US $6.68bn contract with CCECC to complete the remaining segments of the project. These segments include: Ibadan-Osogbo-Ilorin (200 km), Osogbo–Ado Ekiti, Ilorin-Minna (270 km), Minna–Abuja and Kaduna-Kano (305 km). Construction of the second segment (Lagos-Ibadan) was delayed due to heavy spring rains. Construction was further delayed due to the general elections which threatened to cause unrest hence CCECC had to evacuate its Chinese employees as a precaution.
