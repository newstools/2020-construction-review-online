4 villages will be forced to evacuate their land in Lualaba province, Busanga, Zambia to make way for the construction of the 240MW hydropower dam of the Sino-Congolese Hydroelectric Company (Sycohydro). The hydropower dam that has a budget for construction of US$660 million in Busanga is part of sicomines’ “minerals and infrastructure” partnership that despite having disputes with local communities previously, is set to move forwards after the communities demanded better compensation. Various NGOs active in the governance of the energy sector have written to the provincial minister of the interior of Lualaba asking him to postpone the 12-day period granted to the inhabitants of the villages, Kamalenge, Monga Lubuza and Wafinya who are being asked to leave. They want the deadline to extend to a final and satisfactory compromise for all parties. In a statement signed on July 17, the provincial minister asked residents who had already received compensation to release their homes by July 29 to allow Sycohydro to dig the basins useful for the dam’s operation.
