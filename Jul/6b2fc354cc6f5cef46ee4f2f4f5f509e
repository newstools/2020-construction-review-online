Dangote oil Refinery, which is expected to be Africa’s largest oil refinery and the world’s biggest single-train facility upon completion, is set to be operational early next year. This was reported by Devakumar Edwin who is the Dangote Industries Executive Director. Mr. Edwin said that they had initially planned to complete the mechanical works, which would mean the completion of the entire project, by the end of this year and to commission the plant in January next year but there has been a shift of 2 months maximum which he says “it is still within the time frame of completion”.

If it works out well, we will still be able to maintain our original completion dates and if it doesn’t, the maximum delay period will be 2 months,” explained the Dangote Group Executive Director. The Dangote oil refinery complex, like no other refinery complex in the continent, has the capacity to process 650 000 barrels of crude oil per day. Its Pipeline Infrastructure is the largest anywhere in the world, with 1,100 kilometers to handle 3 Billion Standard Cubic Foot of gas per day. Furthermore, the complex features the world’s largest single crude distillation column, and it will have a number of processing units containing more than 65 columns and requiring more than 15 static mixers. The units include residue fluid catalytic cracker, mild hydrocracker, alkylation, naphtha hydrofining, and continuous catalytic reforming units for the production of gasoline and diesel meeting Euro V standards as well as jet fuel adhering to international aviation specifications. Upon completion, the plant will help the West African country to meet its fuel demand and be self-sufficient, and it will also put the country on the list of top global exporters of petroleum-based products.
