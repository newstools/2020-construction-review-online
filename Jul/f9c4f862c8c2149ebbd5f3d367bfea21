It will be designated as a port of destination where cargo would be consolidated for import and export, especially in the South-Western part of Nigeria. The Lagos-Kano standard gauge railway which is currently under construction is aligned to the proposed dry port, making it easy to convey cargo from the seaports in Lagos and to all destinations along the route. The NSC Head of Public Relations said that among other uses, the dry port will also provide a competitive cargo sorting center, bulk breaking as well as cargo-tracking and truck management services.
