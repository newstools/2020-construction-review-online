Tunisia has signed an agreement with the French Independent Power Producer (IPP) Qair (formerly Quadran International) under the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company (STEG) for the construction of what will be Tunisia’s first floating solar photovoltaic power plant. The plant is expected to have a capacity of 200 kWp and will be built in the Berges du Lac district of Tunis on the Lake Banks. The private sector development fund (FASEP)  is going to be in charge of the funding and will support the project.  The Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company (STEG) announced that works on the floating solar photovoltaic power plant will start before the end of the year 2020. The Tunisian Ministry of Energy, Mines and Energy Transition will supervise the project. The floating photovoltaic plant is expected to be commissioned on the Lake Banks by the end of 2021, which is the same year Qair is expected to begin construction on a 10 MWp ground-mounted solar power plant in the governorate of Kasserine in central-western Tunisia.
