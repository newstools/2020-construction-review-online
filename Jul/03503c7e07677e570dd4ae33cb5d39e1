The Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOCL) has selected Hill International to provide project management consultancy services for the development of the corporation’s new US $275m, approximately 60 acre research campus, the Indian Oil Technology Development and Deployment Center. The IOCL’s current research and development facility, which opened in 1972, lacks space for further expansion. Given expansive trends in the company’s research interests, more room is necessary to engage with the myriad of scientific disciplines critical to the company’s future business plans. The IOCL envisions a campus that, in addition to ambitiously serving research and development, surpasses global standards of occupational health and safety as well as environmental sustainability. The company wants the world’s largest and most sustainable net-zero campus.

In addition, the campus will feature recreational, administrative, dining, and utility facilities. The total build-up area will be approximately 194,554 SM. Specifically, the project aims to achieve a LEED v4 Platinum rating. Hill’s project management team will review and confirm all the elements contributing towards the target LEED score. These elements include building orientation and zoning, incident solar radiation, solar shading during solstices and equinoxes, open-space shading, daylight simulation, and site computational fluid dynamics, especially during Monsoon season. Hill’s professionals will also help to ensure proper execution of these environmentally friendly aspects of the project through construction.
