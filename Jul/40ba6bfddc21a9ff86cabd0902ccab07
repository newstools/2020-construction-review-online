The ACCIONA-Ghella consortium led by ACCIONA has been selected by the Province of BC as preferred proponent for the Broadway Subway Project. The project is an extension of the Millennium Line and a key link in Metro Vancouver’s transportation system. The US $1.8bn contract includes the design and construction of 5.7 new kilometres of network, part of which will be underground, including twin tunnels with an excavation diameter of six metres (5.2 metres internal diameter) as well as six new stations. Construction of the subway will involve works starting in 2020, with the new extension opening in 2025. This will be the fifth extension of the metro system that was inaugurated in 1986. Once in service, the journey time on the Millennium Line will take eleven minutes, saving passengers an average of 30 minutes a day while alleviating traffic congestion in the city. The project, using a design-build-finance approach, is funded and delivered by the Government of British Columbia, with contributions from the Government of Canada and the city of Vancouver.

ACCIONA also has extensive experience on its own of constructing metro lines in Spain, Ecuador, Brazil and Dubai as well as railway tunnels.
