Chinese independent utility Foran Energy has signed a gas supply deal with BP that will see the utility company receive 300,000 t/yr of pipeline gas from the 6.7mn t/yr CNOOC-operated Dapeng LNG receiving terminal over two years, starting from 1 January 2021. BP will supply pipeline gas within south China’s Guangdong province from Dapeng under both contracts, with Foran’s supplies distributed to its customers in the Guangdong city of Foshan. BP holds regasification capacity at Dapeng through a 30% stake in the terminal, while Foran holds a 2.5% stake in the terminal where it is also a foundation customer. The transaction allows BP to integrate its upstream gas resources, transportation and trading into China’s downstream markets.
