Sterlite Power has completed its Gurugram Smart City project for creating an intracity fiber network for the city’s communication needs. The company’s Convergence Business had entered a PPP (Public-Private Partnership) agreement with GMDA (Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority) to build, manage and maintain the fiber network in Gurugram sub city 2 for 21 years. In this project, Sterlite Power has installed four underground ducts that carry fibers connecting all the Bus stops, Schools, Police stations, Government buildings along with various private buildings. Two ducts among these are dedicated to Gurugram smart city’s operation and the other two can be commercially used by communication service providers. The entire route is updated through Geographic Information System (GIS) along with an integrated fiber monitoring system for proactive monitoring as well as preventive and corrective maintenance.
