The government of Egypt has announced that it will be putting aside US$2.8 billion for implementation of a five-year plan to construct 47 seawater desalination plants. As Egypt is an arid country, they largely rely on the desalination of seawater from the North and South Sinai, Port Said, Ismailia, Suez, Dakahlia, Kafr E-Sheikh, Beheira Matrouh, and the Red Sea and these are the areas where they have set their ambitious goal for the construction of the desalination plant sites. The implementation of the project will be overlooked by the Holding Company for Water and Wastewater (HCWW), the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) and the General Organization for Physical Planning. The projects are expected to produce 2.44 million mÂ³ of water per day by 2025. They have divided the project into stages with the first stage being to strengthen the water supply in underserved areas, particularly in the governorates of North and South Sinai, the Red Sea and Matrouh.
