In addition to widening 12 bridges and adding three miles of retaining walls, crews will replace all lanes with new concrete pavement and long-life asphalt. The project also includes adding a sound wall on the south side of the highway in the Elmhurst neighborhood, between Stockton Boulevard and 65th Street. To improve clearance for truck traffic, the highway will be lowered at seven overpasses. The project also includes rehabilitation of three pumping plants that move groundwater away from the highway as well as upgrading all signs, ramp metering and intelligent transportation systems. Other recent work by Flatiron in Sacramento includes Central Terminal B at Sacramento International Airport and the widening of California Highway 65 at the Interstate 80 Interchange.
