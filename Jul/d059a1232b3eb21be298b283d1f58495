The construction of the second phase of the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Power Project in Sierra Leone is edging closer to financial closure following the financial support pledge from InfraCo Africa, a multi-government funded company providing early-stage development capital and expertise to develop infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. The Private Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) owned company has guaranteed to offer US$ 6M for the implementation of the renewable energy project which is being developed by Joule Africa. InfraCo Africa becomes the fourth body to pledge to support the Bumbuna II hydropower project. Others are Electrification Financing Initiative (ElectriFI), an investment facility funded by the European Union and managed by European Development Finance Institutions, the Development Bank of South Africa (DBSA), a development finance institution wholly owned by the Government of South Africa and the African Alpha Investment Partners, a London-based investment company established to help bring investment opportunities and capital together across the African continent. Joule Africa hopes to complete the financial leveraging process for its project by next year, so as to begin the actual construction works which will take 48 months to complete.

The electricity will be injected into the country’s power grid through a 225 kV transmission line from Yiben to Freetown. This high voltage line will also be connected to the West African Power Exchange System which interconnects several neighboring countries including Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, and Guinea. This project is expected to have an extremely positive impact, enabling sustainable economic development in the West African country.
