Construction of a stadium in the city of Zomba in Malawi will not be completed on October 5th as expected as only 30% of the work has been completed so far. The project was faced by financial problems initially before the Covid-19 pandemic struck and made matters worse. At the moment, the community hall and the VIP stand have been completed and the contractor is now working on open stands.

First it was the issue of finances, then the design had to be changed and later the contractor removed working equipment and workers when the issue of Covid-19 surfaced. “But later it was resolved that work can continue but with measures put in place to prevent the Coronavirus. This meant that the contractor had to reduce the workforce and so the work is being done very slowly but surely it will come to an end,” said Chaluma.
