Husqvarna group is further strengthening its position in surface preparation through a concrete power trowel acquisition “Power trowels complement our current range in a great way, connecting the entire process from ground compaction to polished concrete floors, and fits well into our divisional strategy to grow our Concrete Surfaces and Floors business. With the addition of the ride-on trowels we will now have a complete offering for concrete surfacing and polishing which will add great value to our customers,” says Henric Andersson, President Husqvarna Group. The new Husqvarna product range of ride-on and walk- behind trowels has successfully been launched in February at World of Concrete in Las Vegas and there is a staggered launch plan throughout 2020 for the rest of the world. The range of Husqvarna ride-on trowels achieves great results on any job site, no matter the size. The ride-on trowels offer the torque, speed and smart features to finish the job at hand with confidence, while delivering exceptional floor flatness. Husqvarna walk-behind trowels are powerful machines, developed to deliver a smooth and durable concrete surface without compromising the operator’s productivity and safety. The new range consists of gas-powered machines ranging from 875 mm to 1 180 mm. The new range of ride-on trowels consists of 2 ×36″ (2 × 900 mm), and 2 ×48″ (2 × 1 200 mm). All machines have an excellent power-to-weight ratio, providing adequate power to the rotors and ensuring high driving speed.
