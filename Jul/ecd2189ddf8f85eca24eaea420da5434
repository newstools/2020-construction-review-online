This government will not tolerate that and will not spare anyone regardless of any party affiliation,” said Msukwa, who was accompanied by his deputy Abida Mia and the ministry’s Principal Secretary Wilson Mollen. Paramount Chief Kyungu of Karonga and Chitipa thanked government for the seriousness it is showing in re-constructing the country that had many short-falls from the previous Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) regime. Kyungu said all security agents need descent houses. He assured the government of traditional authorities’ support towards any project government intends to implement in the area.
