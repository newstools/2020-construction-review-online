A US $141.1m arena is set to be constructed at the Porte de la Chapelle in Paris, France; a sports facility in the new district that will be a key infrastructure for the games which will happen in 2024 in Paris. The facility will have a large 8,000-seat sports hall which will host national and international competitions as soon as it opens, with Paris Basketball installed as the resident team, along with concerts, shows and conferences; two gymnasiums that will be used for community sports as well as serving as an amenity for local residents, and an additional 2,600 square metres property development programme, providing a range of leisure activities and shops. The design and construction budget for the Arena is US $110.6m, to which are added US $22.6m for the two gymnasiums and US $7.9m for the additional property development programme.

It will enable the development of elite sport in Paris and in particular will host badminton, para badminton and para taekwondo events during the games which will happen in 2024 in Paris. As a catalyst in an urban regeneration programme that includes the Gare des Mines-Fillettes mixed development zone, the Arena will be an attractive and integrated addition, giving the district a new impetus by doubling as a focal point for the local population and a venue for major events. The works will begin in the summer of 2020 and delivery is scheduled for July 2023. Bouygues has been awarded the contract to build and provide service and maintenance for 10 years.
