The country also imports a significant amount of electricity mainly from neighboring countries, including Mozambique, South Africa and Zambia. According to Paradzai Chakona, Director of TSS, based on an annual global irradiation of 1,760Kw/h per m2, a solar photovoltaic system with a capacity of 45MW should produce approximately 73,896 MWh of electricity annually, of which 66,500MWh will be sold to the national grid. “As a result, the electricity import bills of Chiredzi in particular and Zimbabwe in general will be significantly reduced,” he affirmed. The electrical installation will be located approximately 12 km west of the TSS headquarters.
