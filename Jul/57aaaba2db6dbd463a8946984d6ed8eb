The Republic of Sierra Leone, informally known as Salone, is set to have a new Seaport constructed at Niti Village in Bonthe District, the Southern Province of the West African country. According to Dr. John Tambi, the chairman of the Presidential Infrastructural Initiative (PII), the project is in its advanced stages.
