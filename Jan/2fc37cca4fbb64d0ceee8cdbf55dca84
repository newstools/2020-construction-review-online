Currently, the Axim, Mensah Guinea, Ningo-Prampram, Cape Coast and Anomabu coastal stretches are experiencing extensive beach erosion posing major threats to life and livelihood; as well as buildings, salt pans, fish landing sites and other infrastructure sited in these areas. Governments over the years have been making investments in coastal protection in order to manage shoreline recession. The successful implementation of these projects will serve to manage shoreline protection for the protection of lives, existing and future physical and social infrastructural development etc. InvestorsÂ  are being encouraged to invest in infrastructure as a result of the reclamation of land.
