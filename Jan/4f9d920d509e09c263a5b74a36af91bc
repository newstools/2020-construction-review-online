He also said that it includes the upgrading of approximately 19 kilometers of connector roads to paved standard and the demolition of the two grade-separated junction overpass bridges at Kangemi (Kaptagat Road) and Uthiru. Other works include the widening of the seven-existing grade-separated junction underpass bridges at Muhuri Road junction, Regen junction, Zambezi, Kiambaa, Chunga Mali and Rironi (Kamandura), to accommodate the widened main roadway. He further mentioned that they will demolish the three existing railway underpass bridges along the road and construct new and larger ones in case of any necessary future developments. Gitaru – Dagoretti Road bridge will also be widened so as to allow for the dualling of the southern bypass/Northern Bypass. The project is being executed by China Wu Yi Construction Company and it is fully funded by the national government of Kenya.
