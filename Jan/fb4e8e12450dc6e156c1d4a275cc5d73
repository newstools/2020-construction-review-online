UK Climate Investment (UKCI) is set to invest US $39m into Kenya’s affordable housing program by financing the construction of 10,000 affordable homes, largely boosting the government’s affordable housing pillar. UKCI is a joint venture between the Green Investment Group and the UK Government’s Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. According to UKCI Managing Director Richard Abel, the increase in Kenya’s urban population, brings with it the need for new affordable housing. “The capital injection will help address this challenge adding that the opportunity would also showcase how more sustainable building designs can help tackle the effects of climate change,” he said. British High Commissioner to Kenya Jane Marriott OBE said the UK was proud to partner with Kenya to tackle the pressing challenges of affordable housing. “UK Climate Investment’s £30 million anchor investment will help build affordable, climate-friendly homes and promote green building standards in Kenya,” she said.
