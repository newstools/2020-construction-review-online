Currently, Chad is experiencing significant temperature increases, and rainfall is becoming increasingly rare. These factors plunge the country into an unprecedented drought, what remains of water is in turn used to irrigate the country’s crops, which accentuates its scarcity. The Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) was however set up to manage Lake Chad and to address water scarcity. The commission has many projects that they are trying to implement. For example IBWTP project plans to replenish the lake by building a dam and 60 miles of canals to pump water uphill from the Congo River to the Chari River and then on to Lake Chad.
