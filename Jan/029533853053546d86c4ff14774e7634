The project is expected to increase the share of hydroelectric power generation in the generating fleet by 112MW of power and 580GWH of output. It will also help to reduce the average cost of kWh generated across the entire park. The overall cost for the project will be US $308m.

The growing economy of the country has also put power supply under pressure. Peak demand was recorded at 1,193MW in 2015, an increase of 29% over the 2011 peak of 925MW. The government has set goals to increase its power production capacity by 2020 to about 4,000MW and 6,000MW by 2030 to meet the rising demand.
