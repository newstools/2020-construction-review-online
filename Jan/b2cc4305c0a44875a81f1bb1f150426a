Uganda plans to develop the Kingfisher and Tilega oilfields at a cost of US $5bn in a bid to expedite the growth of its oil industry. The two oilfields are currently the subject of a tax dispute between government and three oil companies. According to Permanent Secretary of Energy, Robert Kasande, this amount forms part of the US $15bn to US $20bn projected to flow into the country’s developing oil industry in three to five years, including the construction of a refinery and crude pipeline. “The funding will be used to drill over 500 wells and construct two central processing facilities and a water plant. Plans are also in the pipeline to award exploration companies five blocks by the end of this year,” he affirmed.
