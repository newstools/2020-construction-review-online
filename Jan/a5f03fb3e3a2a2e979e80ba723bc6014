Gas Insulation Switchgear (GIS) is state-of-art advanced switchgear technology available in the market, which reduces the footprint of substations and allow for reliable, maintenance free and safe operation in substations. GIS is suitable where there is need to make a substation as compact as possible. Benefits of GIS are maintenance free, safety and reliable operations at high voltages, economic efficiency, long service life and reliable operations even under extreme environmental conditions. A successful IET’s implementation of GIS technology project was for a leading milling industry completed by IET in 2019. Client has 3 milling plants, each metered at 11kV (CI2) tariff. Total monthly consumption of the 3 milling units were around 2.4MkWH. With this consumption at 11kv tariff, utility bills were high thus the need for upgrade of tariff from CI2 (11kV) to a cheaper tariff at a higher voltage. IET proposed a compact 66KV Substation GIS – ICOG (Incoming and outgoing) feeder with 12.5MVA transformer to combine all 3 mills electrical requirements and meter at 66KV (CI4) tariff. Operating at 66KV (CI4) tariff, the client now enjoys reduced space, reduced monthly bills due to less units’ charges, improved power stability and quality, single billing point instead of initial 3 points of 11KV each, and less power interruptions. As a result, the client has reduced the generator running cost, improved the milling efficiency and will be able to get his returns within a period of 4 years.
