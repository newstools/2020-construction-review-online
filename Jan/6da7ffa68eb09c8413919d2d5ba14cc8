The construction of Rusumo Hydroelectric Power Station to generate 80MW has now reached 59% compared to 32% in June last year. The revelations were made by the outgoing chairman of Energy Ministers from Tanzania, Burundi and Rwanda, Tanzanian Minister for Energy, Dr Medard Kalemani, while briefing the media on the 11th meeting of ministers. “After inspection, my fellow energy ministers and I were satisfied with the construction progress,” said the minister. Rusumo Hydroelectric Power Station, also known as Rusumo Power Station, is a hydropower plant project, which involves the construction of a dam shared by Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. Dr Kalemani noted that a team of ministers from the three East African countries – Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi – rejected the contractor’s request to extend the project period. “We have directed the contractor and a team of supervisors to complete the project in February this year,” he said.
