Construction works on One Za’abeel Tower, a two skyscraper building in Dubai with the world’s longest cantilever is over 30% complete. The two skyscrapers, Tower A and Tower B stand at 300m and 235m respectively over a total built-up area of 470,700 square meters and they are joined by a 228-meter steel bridge that will constitute a tower in itself. According to the project state-owned developer Ithra Dubai, the bridge, also known as the “The Link”, will be the longest cantilever in the world. The 9,000-ton structure is being assembled in seven sections along a bespoke horizontal slide at podium level 25m above ground, before being jacked into position at a height of approximately 100m and secured to the towers. A section of more than 60m of the entire bridge will extend beyond the towers into the open sky.
