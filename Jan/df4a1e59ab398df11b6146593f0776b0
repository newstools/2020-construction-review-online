The construction of 2 000 affordable houses in Naivasha, that targets workers earning between US $150 and US $1500 per month, is set to begin next month. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui said that they are currently in the process of evaluating bids for the project and that they expect contractors to kick off construction works from February. Built under a joint partnership between the Nakuru County government, the World Bank and the United Kingdom, the hoses will be situated on a 55-acre piece of land in Naivasha on the Nairobi-Nakuru highway near GK Prisons.

Several local and foreign investors have also expressed interest in setting up structures and businesses at the SEZ. “With Naivasha hosting a multibillion-shilling flourishing horticultural sector, a booming hospitality industry, and fast-rising to a commercial hub in East Africa, obviously, the demand for housing is expected to shoot up,” said Governor Kinyanjui. He mentioned that that is why they are speeding up the plans to ensure that the need for housing, for workers in the various companies that seek to set up businesses, is quenched. Last year, Nakuru was selected by the World Bank as the pioneer county for the realization of the ambitious half a million houses project by 2022. The international lender said that Nakuru needed the critical infrastructure the most. Besides the expected growth of the population in the county, Nakuru already has insufficient housing infrastructure despite efforts to address the shortage.
