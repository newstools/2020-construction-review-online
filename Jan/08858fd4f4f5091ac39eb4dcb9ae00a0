The repair works on the road also included cleaning of the entire drainage path of about 1.5 kilometres from the bridge, through communities to outer Marina into the lagoon, blocked by illegal refuse disposal. Mr. Kuti explained that the depression of the Apongbon Bridge was prone to heavy flooding in the past, due to drain stuffing attitude that blocked the channels. He appealed to residents using drainage channels as refuse dumps to change their attitudes and begin to protect government infrastructure as their personal property. “As the road has been repaired, we appeal to Lagosians to use government property as their own. Those who are blocking drainages should desist from such. Motorists and other road users should drive with care within the Federal Roads Safety Corps stipulated speed limits. With the repair, we have reduced travel time and the security challenges, because bad boys were using the bad portion of the road to rob motorists,’’ said Mr. Kuti.
