The Kenyan national government has launched the construction of a state-of-the-art Girls boarding School in Mpeketoni, Lamu County. The US $535,623 School will be a much need addition to the few available Girls schools in the area. According to Lamu West MP Stanley Muthama, preparations for the implementation of the project which will be entirely funded by the Lamu West National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF), are already underway. “Lamu has very few girls’ secondary schools and this has subsequently contributed to a very low level of the girl child education in the region. That is why we arrived at the decision to introduce another girl’s secondary school here in Mpeketoni. The project is ongoing. In fact we have begun by setting up temporary structures and Form one and two students are already learning. We thank God that a principal has also been posted to the institution. We expect the school will accommodate 800 students once complete,” he added.

The shortage of such schools in Lamu has for decades contributed to poor performance by girls. Lamu has three public girls’ secondary schools. They include Lamu Girls High School – the only girls’ national school in the region – Shella Bright Girls Secondary School and the Pate Girls Secondary which was officially opened by Deputy President William Ruto in December 2018. A few other schools, including Sacred Heart Girls Secondary in Mpeketoni, are private.
