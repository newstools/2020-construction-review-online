Egypt has launched the largest military base in the Middle East. President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi performed the inauguration ceremony of the base which is aimed at protecting and securing the southern Egyptian coasts, protecting economic investments and natural resources in the area, confronting security challenges within the Red Sea, and securing global navigation traffic through the Red Sea to the country’s Suez Canal and related economic areas. The military base which is named ‘Berenice military base’ sits on a 150,000 acre of land. It located on the Red Sea coast along Egypt’s southern borders, approximately 90 km north of the Halayib Triangle, an Egyptian-controlled area disputed by Sudan.  It features a naval base, an airbase, an army hospital, some combat and administrative units, and fields of shooting and training for all weapons.
