Located in Nyabizan on the Ntem River in the South region, 300 km from Yaounde,The Memve’ele Hydroelectric power plant is one of the biggest in Cameroon with a capacity of  211MW of electricity. The Earth fill dam is 20 meters high having a reservoir of 19 million m3 of water. Water from the reservoir is channelled through the canal to the power house for the production of energy. Among other features of the dam include; headrace channel, intake tower, secondary dam, living camp for contractors, homogeneous earth dam, power house, tail race tunnel, and tail race outlet. The Memve’ele Hydroelectric power plant is expected to provide sufficient energy to resolve the electricity deficit in the southern part of Cameroon. According to World Bank estimates, 62% of Cameroonians are without electricity. The installed capacity in Cameroon would be 1,400 MW, compared to a demand of around 2000 MW each year.
