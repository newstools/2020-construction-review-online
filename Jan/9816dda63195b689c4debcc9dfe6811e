Construction of the Pan African Postal Union (PAPU) headquarters building at Sekei ward in Arusha, Tanzania has kicked-off. This is after the final agreements were cleared, to give the long awaited project a green light. The Minister of Works, Transport and Communication, Engineer Isaac Kamwelwe, PAPU and Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) senior officials handed over the plot to the contractor, Beijing Engineering Construction Limited, who is scheduled to carry out the construction and complete the 17-storey building in 30 months.

The offer for land was given to PAPU by Mwalimu Nyerere, but it is in the fifth phase government under President John Magufuli that the handover of the plot and construction takes place,” said Mr Kamwelwe. Eng Kamwelwe said mobilisation of personnel and clearing of the site by the contractor was to start instantaneously, including laying of the foundation stone which is set to take place later this month during a meeting of 45 PAPU member countries that will take place in Arusha to mark 40 years anniversary of the Union. He said construction of the building in Tanzania is an opportunity for employment to Tanzanians during and after the construction, calling upon state organs to ensure the area is well protected and no trespass happens. The sky scrapping complex is bankrolled by PAPU and TCRA.
