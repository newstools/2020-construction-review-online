Nigeria has commenced construction of the the first flyover in the North-east region. Borno State Governor, Prof. Babagana Umara launched the project. The flyover project will connect three routes, including linking Maiduguri to Dikwa-Ngala economic road that leads to neighbouring countries-Cameroon and Chad. It will be 2.4 kilometre long with two opposite lanes on top of the bridge and at the bottom.

It will channel around the Post Office Roundabout at the centre of Maiduguri. According to the Governor, the flyover is intended to ease traffic at the normally congested Customs roundabout in Maiduguri. Prof Umara further said that he was opening up the state capital as part of responses to increase the number of vehicles on the road caused by population growth largely instigated by forced migration of families who have permanently settled in Maiduguri as a result of displacement by insurgents. Umara added that new routes are also expected to contribute to better flow of traffic as well as matters of security and emergencies and ongoing and planned township roads would also be delivered. “I intend to complete and start many other road projects this year as already provided for in the budget that was recently signed into law. The government will ensure that roads like Maiduguri-Bama-Banki, Maiduguri-Dikwa-Ngala, and Damboa-Chibok-Mbalala are delivered,” said Prof. Babagana.
