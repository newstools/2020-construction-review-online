The program is designed to enhance institutional performance of 14 Municipal Councils so as to improve urban service delivery. The USMID program is being implemented in a context where Uganda since 1986 has experienced high economic growth, poverty reduction and an average annual GDP growth of 8.1 % over the last six years (2003/2004- 2009/2010). It has reduced donor assistance from 52% of the annual budget in the early 1990s to the current level of 32%. USMID is contributing to the Second National Development Plan (2010/2011-2014/2015) which has identified Infrastructure as one of the complementary sectors for growth.
