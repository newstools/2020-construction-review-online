The Arab Republic of Egypt has officially begun the construction of Middle East’s largest integrated private medical city following the groundbreaking ceremony of the project which was officiated by Egyptian Housing Minister Assem al-Gazzar. The project is owned by Egyptians for Health Care Services Two (EHCS), and it is one of the Badr City’s mega projects, which has been affected positively recently due to the New Administrative Capital’s development. The project is sited on 57 acres of new development across the new capital city of Egypt on Cairo Suez road, it is poised to be an anchor and catalyst to the surrounding area. Its landscape design proposes a balance between sustainable, low water use, native landscape and a green, shaded retreat. The desert landscape surrounding the site transitions into low maintenance, cost-effective, xerophytic landscape that creates a landscape buffer between the desert/road and the internal courtyards of the medical campus. Specific gardens in the premises are connected to relevant buildings so as to ensure that the outdoor spaces can be utilized as an extension of the internal medical facilities.
