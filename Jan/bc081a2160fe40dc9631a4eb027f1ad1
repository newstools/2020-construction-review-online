King Faisal Hospital in Rwanda is set to undergo US $20m facelift. King Faisal Hospital acting Chief Executive Dr Edgar Kalimba affirmed the report and said the upgrade has been on the pipeline for a number of years and was expected to kick off during the previous management under Oshen Group, whose contract government terminated last year in April. “This is the start of an upgrade that aims at making the 30-year-old facility more efficient and effective. The Government is financing the project through different mechanisms,” said Kalimba. King Faisal is country’s biggest referral hospital in Rwanda. To further improve patient’s experience, they are in the process of hiring medical specialists in fields that they deem lacking in skills and are in high demand. Between 10 and 15 medical experts are expected to join the hospital which currently has about 40 specialists working both part-time and fulltime. Kalimba, affirmed that the hospital was in sound financial position following the Government’s investment, which has allowed them to undertake the upgrade and specialist recruitment.
