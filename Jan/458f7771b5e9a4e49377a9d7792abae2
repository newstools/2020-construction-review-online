According to World Bank, Nigeria housing deficit is estimated around 16 million units and it requires more than US $ 154bn to provide the 16 million housing units to bridge the housing deficit at a conservation cost of US $10,000 per unit in the country. The housing deficit has been caused by rapid urbanization and population growth in developing cities in Nigeria such as Abuja, Lagos, Port Harcourt, Kano, Kaduna, Enugu etc. When the cities grow too rapidly, resources are unable to keep up, forcing residents to build temporary housing without proper utilities.
