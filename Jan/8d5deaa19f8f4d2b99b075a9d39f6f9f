The Diaz Wind farm Power project in the region deǁKaras in Namibia is gaining momentum after the independent power producer (IPP) Diaz Wind Power, which is developing the project, recently obtained land from the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism for the construction of its wind farm. The land is located not far from the city of Lüderitz. Diaz Wind Power is expected to rent the land for a period of 25 years. The joint venture formed by United Africa Group and Quantum Power will exploit the energy potential of the region deǁKaras by installing wind turbines capable of delivering 44MW. With the award of the land, the project is expected to enter the construction phase, as Diaz Wind Power has already concluded other agreements with the Namibian authorities. The company estimates that its wind farm will be capable of supplying electricity to 10,000 Namibian homes. This is an important output for Namibia, which depends on its neighbours for its electricity supply.

To connect the wind farm to NamPower’s grid, IPP will build a substation and a 27km transmission line that will connect the wind farm to NamPower’s 132 kV substation in Namib. Diaz Wind Power has also committed to upgrade the Namib substation and the Kokerboom substation. The project is expected to require a total investment of about US $106.9m. The IPP also plans to expand the future wind farm. This could increase its capacity from 44MW to 90MW. The power project is definitely a good start in the country’s energy empowerment policy.
