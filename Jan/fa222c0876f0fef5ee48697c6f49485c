The city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates is set to be home to the world’s tallest hotel in the next 3 years following the completion of the ongoing construction works of Ciel towers. Designed by NORR, and developed by The First Group (TFG), the tower is being constructed at Marina district, in close proximity to the most popular attractions like the Marina Walk and the Marina Mall shopping and entertainment complex. Comprising of 1,209 luxury suites and serviced residences split across 82 floors, Ciel towers will stand 360 meters tall, approximately 4 meters taller than Gevora hotel, the current world’s tallest hotel. The inside of the glass sculpture, inspired by the concept of vertical living, will be all about contemporary interiors motivated by the Japanese philosophy of Wabi-sabi, “a philosophy rooted in the appreciation of the imperfect and impermanent beauty of objects in nature” with a side of luxury and allocated green spaces.
