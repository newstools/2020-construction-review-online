In the recent years, an effort has been made for the electrification of major cities of the country, but the rural electrification is still challenging. Over 90% of Togolese urban households do not have access to clean cooking. The supply of butane gas channels are not sufficiently decentralized and the gas price and the purchase cost of user equipment significantly limit the access of the majority of the population to modern cooking fuel.
