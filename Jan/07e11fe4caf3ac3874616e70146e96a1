Building this overground metro will require the construction of 24 bridges, one viaduct over a lagoon, 34 pedestrian footbridges and eight underpasses. The project will be carried out by a consortium of French companies including Bouygues Travaux Publics, Colas Rail and Alstom. The construction phase of Line 1 of the Abidjan Metro, which will begin with excavation work will start at the end of 2020. The effective start date of the works and contract acceptance are subject to the fulfillment of two conditions: the Ivorian State making all the land available and the finalization of financing for the project in conjunction with the French authorities. When completed it will be capable of carrying 500,000 passengers per day Ivory Coast has a total of  660 kilometres of railway most of them built during the French colonial period. The lines links the port city of Abidjan with Ouagadougou, and the capital of Burkina Faso.
