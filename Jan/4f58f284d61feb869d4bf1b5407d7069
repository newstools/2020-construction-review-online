Kenya has announced plans to construct a US $17m water treatment plant in Kericho County with the aim of curbing perennial water shortage in the county. The County County Governor Paul Chepkwony made the announcement and said that the bank has issued out conditions to the Kericho Water and Sanitation Company (Kewasco) to provide 10 acres for the construction of the water treatment and distribution plant.

This is because the point allows water to flow by gravity and is the cheapest option,” said Governor Chepkwony. The water plant dubbed ‘Kimugu Water Treatment Plant’ is being funded by Germany KfW Development Bank. It is set for completion in April 2021. According to Governor Paul Chepkwony, the project will benefit more than 200,000 households in Ainamoi and Belgut constituencies once complete.
