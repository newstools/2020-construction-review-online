The government of Ghana has broken ground for construction works to begin on the Benchema Junction-Adjoafua road. Vice President of the Republic, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia cut sod for the project. The 38km road project was initially supposed to begin construction in 2011 and 2014 but has faced delays in both years after the contract was terminated on the advice of the Cocoa Roads Audit Committee when the NPP assumed office. The Vice President has however affirmed that the road will be completed. “This is the vision we wish to realize for our people and nation, in which the road network serves as the live wire and the circulatory system, transporting the vital produce needed by all other sectors to all other parts of the country,” said Dr Mahamudu Bawumia.
