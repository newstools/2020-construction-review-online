Upon completion, the water supply facility will inject an additional 23,000 cubic metres of water daily, benefiting about 50,000 residents within Eldoret town and its environs. 90% of the beneficiaries will come from Langas ward while 60% and 70% of residents in Kapseret and Kipkenyo Wards will access the water supplied from the dam. According to the area County Commissioner, Abdirisack Jaldesa, the Kipkarren Dam Water Supply is one of the flagship projects of the Jubilee Government in Uasin Gishu County and being one of the fastest growing towns with population increasing rapidly, water demand will continue to rise. “Investments and businesses associated with city status will not survive without a sustainable source of water that is why the National Government prioritized the water project that is key to the pillars of the Big Four Agenda,” said Mr. Abdirisack. According to Eldoret Water and Sanitation Company (ELDOWAS) Board Chairman, Andrew Chelogoi, demand for water to Eldoret Municipality is currently estimated at 60,000 cubic meters per day, against a production of 47,950 cubic meters daily. The town currently relies mainly on Chebara Dam whose source is in Elgeyo-Marakwet County, producing 18 000 m3 of water per day.
