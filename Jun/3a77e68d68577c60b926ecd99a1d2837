UK-based firm RES will begin construction and eventual operation of Pv (photovoltaic) parks beginning in the year 2021 in  the Alpes de Haute-Provence. The power generated will be sold to SNCF a French railway operator. The 15 year power purchase agreement agreement will help reduce the French operator’s consumption of non-renewable energy. SNCF, a French railway operator, has agreed to a 20-year endorsement that is expected to have the operator be provided with solar power for 2% of its total electrical consumption. The operator signed a 25 year green corporate PPA (power purchase agreement) in 2019 that states that it would purchase solar power worth 143 MW from a fellow French corporation that develops renewables, Voltalia. In a statement the company released in 2019, they said that they would be planning to “sign six to seven times the volume of that deal over the next two or three years.”
