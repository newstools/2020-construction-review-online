The project involves the construction of pile foundations and a Bailey bridge (a short-term bridge of lattice steel designed for quick assembly from prefabricated parts) with movable main steel bridge in the middle of the channel to allow movement of ships. The project has been awarded to China Road and Bridge Construction (CRBC) and according to a statement by KeNHA, the effective date for the commencement of the contract is May 20 this year and the project is to be completed in six months time. The over US$ 14M project, fully funded by the government of Kenya, comes ahead of the long-awaited Likoni permanent bridge whose development reportedly remains at the design and consultancy stage with the date of beginning construction yet to be announced. Not to be confused with the long-delayed permanent bridge across the water body, the floating temporary pedestrian bridge is expected to address the problem faced by the residents of Likoni in accessing Mombasa Island and vice versa upon completion, and above all ease congestion on ferries and lower risk of contracting Covid-19 on the vessels that ferry more than 300,000 commuters every day. Likoni sub-county commissioner, Francis Kazungu said that the majority of Likoni residents work outside the area, mostly in Mombasa town, and use the ferry crossing each day and they have had serious challenges as far as maintaining social distancing is concerned.
