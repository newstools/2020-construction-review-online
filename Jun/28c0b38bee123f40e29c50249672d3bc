US$48.8 million has been granted by the European Investment Bank (EIB) for investment in the ongoing construction of one of the largest solar projects in Spain, the Cabrera Solar Project that will be constructed in Andalusia where it will be the biggest of it’s kind. The Cabrera Solar Project includes the construction and operation of four 50MW PV solar plants in Alcalá de Guadaira, Seville. As of May this year, 86% per cent of the project had been completed in spite of the disruption caused by the current global pandemic. The project is backed by the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), and the main goal for the project is to provide clean energy for the citizens of Andalusia and Spain at large. Along with providing clean energy for Spain, the project will provide over 350 job opportunities and provide clean energy to nearly 150 000 households each year which is projected to reduce the carbon-dioxide emissions by 300 metric kilotons (kt) every year.
