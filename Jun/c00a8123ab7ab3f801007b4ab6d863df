The Tuen Mun South (TMS) project is a plan to extend Hong Kong’s West Rail Line south by 2.4km which has been approved by the regional government and state-owned transport firm MTR. The Tuen Mun South (TMS) project will extend the line from Tuen Mun Station, in the southeast of the New Territories, and add two more, at Tuen Mun Ferry Pier and Tuen Mun Area 16. The aim is to improve access to public transport for the community south of Tuen Mun town centre. Some 60,000 residents live in a 500m radius of the existing station, and 49,000 live in a 500m radius of the Area 16 station. Also read: China lays tracks for 1,000km/h maglev trains, Hubei. The Hong Kong government said in a press release: “The TMS Extension with the Area 16 Station will offer an alternative commuting choice to residents and divert more commuters to rail-based transport, which may help relieve congestion on the roads. Furthermore, the provision of the proposed A16 Station is essential for unleashing the potential for residential development at the A16 site and helps increase the housing supply.” It added that the extension would save the public a cumulative total of about 300 million hours of commuting time over 50 years of operation. Construction of the project is due to begin in 2023 and to be completed in 2030.
