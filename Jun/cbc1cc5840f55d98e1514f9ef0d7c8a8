On the other hand, the second phase will benefit 41 more underserved villages, and it is projected to improve the lives of 240,000 more people and bring the total sanitation access in the regions to 86 percent.

The project is a part of a wider set of measures put in place by the Egyptian government to address the challenges the North African country faces in regard to sanitation coverage.
