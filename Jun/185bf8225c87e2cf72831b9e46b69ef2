A mid-rise student housing development is set to be constructed near California State University, Sacramento (“Sacramento State”) in US. This is after AECOM-Canyon Partners (“ACP”), in a joint venture with The Martin Group announced the closing of a US $73.3m senior construction loan from Pacific Western Bank to begin the transit-oriented project of Wexler on 65th. The property is located less than a 5-minute walk from the university’s Hornet Crossing entrance and adjacent to several retail and dining options. It is directly adjacent to Sacramento Regional Transit Authority’s (“SacRT”) University/65th St. Gold Line light rail station, providing direct service to downtown Sacramento in approximately 11 minutes. In March 2020, the joint venture began the reconstruction and modernization of bus stops for the SacRT on 67th and Q streets, as part of the Wexler’s off-site improvement plan. The 223-unit project will offer a mix of studio, two-, three-, four-, and five-bedroom units, featuring bedroom-bathroom parity, in addition to numerous tenant amenities, ample parking, and approximately 7,400 square feet of commercial space. Construction of the project is scheduled to commence in June 2020, bringing hundreds of job opportunities to the community, and is scheduled to reach completion by Fall 2022.
