The Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) in Gauteng, South Africa has rolled out more water tanks to water stressed communities, as government eases the lockdown regulations under alert level 3. This particular move follows a call by President Cyril Ramaphosa for needy communities to be targeted for water supply to mitigate the impact of COVID -19 on vulnerable communities. Water tanks have been supplied on a continuous basis across Gauteng to communities residing in overcrowded areas since the outbreak of the pandemic, because it is feared that a significant number of people may be affected. These areas include: Johannesburg, Tshwane, Ekurhuleni and the District Municipalities of Sedibeng and West Rand.

In addition to supplying water tanks to congested communities, schools are also receiving water tanks to ensure they meet the health and safety standards required to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.
