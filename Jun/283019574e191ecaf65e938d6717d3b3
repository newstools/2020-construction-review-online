The Rail Baltic project which is currently underway has been reported to be unstable financially according to an audit released by the European Union Court Auditors (ECA). The report stated that the estimated budget for the project has increased by over 50% in the past eight years. The initial budget for the project was US$5.2 billion and has now increased to US$7.8 billion. Currently, the official cost is US$6.5 billion. The ongoing greenfield railway infrastructure that is projected to link Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland is supposed to provide passenger and cargo services across the mentioned countries and improve the transportation links between the countries. The ECA does not consider the Rail Baltic project to be a high-speed railway but rather a regular cargo railway as a high-speed railway is one that has trains that can travel at speeds of up to 250 km/h and the expected top speeds of the rail are not going to surpass 249 km/h.
