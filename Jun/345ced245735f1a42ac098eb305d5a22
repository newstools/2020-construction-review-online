The entire components of the mall surround a large central garden that provides a space for socializing and relaxation. Inspired by traditional Andalusian architecture and landscaping incorporating Arabic gardens, fountains, geometric shapes, and clever use of shading, the project was designed to maximize environmental sustainability. Chapman Taylor, an award-winning practice of global architects and master planners famous for designing places and buildings that are both creative and successful, created the concept design for the mixed-use Arribat Centre and performed an oversight role in the initial construction phases. All components of the scheme are open as of now, apart from the hotel which is expected to follow soon.
