Construction of the 49,000-tonne concrete base for the second reactor at Hinkley Point C is now completed. The base was made from 20,000 m3 of nuclear grade concrete which was poured in using boom cranes. Work at the Somerset site has been continuing during the coronavirus lockdown with social distancing measures in place to protect workers. The concrete base for the first reactor was completed in June 2019, the next milestone is to build the roof of the first reactor. The site should be completed by 2025.

The system transports the steam needed to drive the turbine generator unit and ultimately produce low-carbon electricity. The Nuclear Island is at the heart of the nuclear power plant, including the reactor, the steam generators and primary safety and piping systems. The contracts will be booked in tranches under Bilfinger’s Technologies and Engineering & Maintenance Europe segments. The work on the two contracts will begin immediately and continue until 2025. Most recently, Bilfinger had booked contracts for the Balance of Plant (BoP) package as well as design preparation and planning work for the solid waste treatment systems. Hinkley Point C is the first new nuclear power station to be built in the UK in over 25 years. It is expected to provide low-carbon electricity for around 6 million homes, create thousands of jobs and bring lasting benefits to the UK economy.
