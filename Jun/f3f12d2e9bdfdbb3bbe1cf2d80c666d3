There are many countries in Latin America and Europe with a growing demand for gensets providing low sound levels, therefore contributing to greater social well-being, and at the same time guaranteeing to cover power requirements, be it for continuous or for emergency use. Genesal Energy designed, manufactured, and supplied a total of 18 super-soundproof gensets, to one of these countries in western South America, Chile to be precise, a market with great possibilities and in constant expansion in the energy sector especially in the field of renewable energy. The generator sets were tailor-made according to the client’s needs, and two different models were designed (five gensets of 500/550 kVA and 12 of 1000/1100 kVA), but with a common denominator: their great level of sound attenuation: 65 dB at seven meters distance at the point of maximum emission. To achieve this, Genesal Energy’s engineering team and the sales department who always work in tight cooperation, kept the basic cooling requirements into account, without surpassing the length and width of the 40’HC shipping container which encases the generator sets.  In the 550kVA unit, the company installed a medium voltage step-up transformer, and in the 1.100 kVA, a 3.000-liter double-walled fuel tank inside the container, as well as control cabinets, silencers, etc. In order to achieve a sound level of 65dB, it was necessary to decrease the sound levels by 43’5 and 48 dB respectively. The company, therefore, selected different materials and solutions, some applied in exactly the same way in both models and others which had to be modified so as to conform to the unique characteristics of each unit that went beyond their engine’s respective power ratings so as to comply with the technical specifications requested by the client. During the assembly, special attention was given to all elements which might be susceptible to filtering the noise to the outside or generating any vibrations. Finally, once the open-field tests of the prototypes had been carried out following the indications and procedure set by the applicable regulations, the results were as follows: – GEN1100TC: 64.5dB (A) at 7m distance – GEN1100TC: 64.5dB (A) at 7m distance
