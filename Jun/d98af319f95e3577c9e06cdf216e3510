The project will be implemented under the first phase of the Ghana Secondary Cities Support Programme that seeks to improve urban management and basic urban services in 255 selected municipality in the Upper West Region of the West African country. The Ghana Secondary Cities Support Program is a part of the broader Urban Development and Decentralization Action Plan of the government of the Republic of Ghana. It is funded by the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) that helps the world’s poorest developing countries by providing concessional grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve people’s lives. The program’s aim is to ensure the effective and efficient management of urban centers by strengthening local systems and focus on municipal assemblies through the provision of incentives to improve their performance as city managers. It will also assist regional and national institutions to provide municipal assemblies with the support needed for effective urban management and basic service delivery.
