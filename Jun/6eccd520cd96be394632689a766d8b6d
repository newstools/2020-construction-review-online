Tanzania’s first-ever wind farm, the Mwenga project has officially been completed after being under construction from April in 2018. The 2.4 MW project that was developed by Enercon, a German manufacturer, required a US$1.2 that was granted but the United Kingdom Government-funded Renewable Performance Platform and is expected to be connected to the already present grid network that provides electricity across the country. The wind farm that is found in the Iringa region of Tanzania consists of three turbines that will provide additional power to the area’s grid that also receives electricity from the existing 4MW hydropower plant that is owned by Rift Valley Corporation, a corporation that deals with the development of renewable energies. The hydropower plant has been providing electricity to the area for eight years and has enabled the country to provide electricity to nearly 5,000 homes. The additional power from the wind farm is expected to increase that number to 6,500 homes and business once operational.
