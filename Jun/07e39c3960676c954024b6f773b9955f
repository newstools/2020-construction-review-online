He also called upon the citizens working and living in the Lekki region to be cooperative in order to make the project a reality, pointing out that it might be accompanied by some temporally inconveniences but ultimately it would bring the long-sought relief in regards to traffic. Upon completion in the next 24 months, the road will connect the Lekki-Epe expressway at Victoria Garden City (VGC) junction to the Freedom Way in Eti Osa. It is also expected to set grounds for the construction of the proposed Fourth Mainland Bridge. The regional road, which according to the Lagos State’s Governor is a manifestation of his administration’s commitment towards improving socio-economic activities in the Lekki-Epe region through the provision of supporting infrastructure, would not only change the entire landscape of Eti Osa and improve journey time for commuters but also boost the efficiency of government’s traffic management strategy. Mrs. Aramide Adeyoye, the special adviser to the governor on works and infrastructure, said that the regional road remains strategic to addressing the infrastructural need of the Lekki sub-region, as the state’s new economic center.
