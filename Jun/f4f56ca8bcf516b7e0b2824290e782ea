China’s leading energy and chemical company Sinopec has announced the completion of what it claims to be the world’s first and largest slurry-bed residue hydrogenation reactor in Zhoushan. The largest single-unit hydrogenation reactor, designed by Sinopec Engineering, weighs 3,025 tonnes and has a height of 72m. With an outside diameter of 6.156m and wall thickness of 320mm, the reactor forms the core equipment of China’s Zhejiang Petroleum and Chemical’s (ZPCC) 40-million-tonne/year refining-chemical integration project, phase II.

The 5,200-tonne hydraulic gantry lifting system has the advantages of lifting heavy weights, shifting integrally, and requiring fewer steps of assembly & disassembly of the middle tower, this solution effectively minimised the impact on the construction site and shortened the overall construction period. The 5,200-tonne hydraulic gantry lifting system is planned to be relocated integrally for the installation of the second hydrogenation reactor.
