Leeds City Council (LCC) has resolved to grant detailed planning permission for the next 200,000 sq ft of commercial space at the US $496.2m Kirkstall Forge project in Leeds. 2 Kirkstall Forge, the next phase of the project, is capable of accommodating a workforce of up to 2,000 people within two office buildings, with leisure and retail uses on the ground floor. The upper floors will provide flexible office accommodation with open floor plates from 11,000 sq ft to 15,300 sq ft. In line with the site’s strong sustainability credentials, there will be electric car charging, a cycle spa, shower rooms, locker facilities, as well as outdoor rooms and balcony features maximising the wooded, riverside views. According to Paul Richardson, Investment Manager at CEG, this next phase of development will bring some of the most advanced office space to Leeds. “The buildings are available for pre let, with workspace being offered through our Core and Flex model which allows a business to expand and contract within the space. This will help to manage company growth and additional projects, as well as seasonal demand and the effects that social distancing will have on office requirements,” he said.

Ultimately, the Kirkstall Forge project is set to become home to a thriving mixed-use community comprising of up to 1,500 new homes, 300,000 sq ft of offices and 100,000 sq ft of retail, leisure and community space. The site connects to Leeds City Station in six minutes by rail and offers on-site cycle, car and scooter hire and electric vehicle charging.
