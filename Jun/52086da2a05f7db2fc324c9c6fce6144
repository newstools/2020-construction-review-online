The first phase construction of the Namugongo Martyrs’ Museum which encompasses the martyrs’ museum core site structure currently housing sculptures depicting the story of the Uganda martyrs, the boundary wall, and two public toilets is still ongoing. The pending works include building a boundary wall and the main entrance gate finishing and landscaping at the Museum core-site, fixing of wooden doors and windows with glasses, internal and external finishing, and electrical works finishing including CCTV system, fire detection and fighting, solar and lighting system and others. Bishop Matovu said that they also plan to install an Electronic audio-visual system for the tourists in the museum and a wooden walkway as a guide in the execution areas. The redevelopment of the Namugongo Anglican site into a world-class faith-based and pilgrimage tourist center began in 2014, and it is mainly aimed at enhancing the image and potential of the site where 25 Christian converts were killed in 1886.
