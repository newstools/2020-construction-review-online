There will also be a three-star hotel of international standards, with conference centers and two university restaurants all on an area of approximately 15 hectares. The project is a part of an overall project called “Cameroon State University Cities Development” (CSUCD) that aims to provide students from the Central African Country and those from other states in the sub-region with furnished accommodation at reasonable prices, and above all reduce the housing deficit. The University of Yaoundé II was chosen as the pilot structure for this project after an agreement between ETG and the government of the Republic of Cameroon. The Minister of Higher Education, Jacques Fame Ndongo, praised the initiative saying that it is exactly what the government needs in order to realize suitable and modern university infrastructures. ETG is described as a group of world-class professional consultants, investing in the construction and development of equipped housing in universities in North America, Europe, and Africa.
