Wattec has recently commissioned a solar power plant on the rooftop of ABC, a construction company based in Antananarivo, Madagascar. The installation reinforces the autonomy of ABC with regard to the Madagascan national electricity network. ABC passe connects itself to green energy. The site of Ivandry’s construction company in Tananarive is now supplied with electricity from a photovoltaic solar power plant that has just been mounted on its roof. The power station consists of 270 solar panels connected to each other by inverters. The 94.5 kWp capacity plant was commissioned by Wattec, an engineering, equipment supply and solar thermal and photovoltaic company based in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. According to Wattec, ABC has chosen the path of energy transition through an investment with multiple social, fiscal and economic interests. The installation allows ABC to significantly reduce its electricity bills, ensuring 95% of the company’s daytime needs.
