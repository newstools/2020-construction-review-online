US$131.4 million has been granted by Denmark’s largest bank, the Danske Bank, to further fund the Assela wind project in Ethiopia. The funding was transferred during a virtual conference between the Director and Associate Director of Danske Bank, Petterson and Olaf S. Mark Schet, & the Ethiopian Finance Minister, Ahmed Shide. It is the second instalment of funding from Denmark who provided US$201 million in 2018. Aside from Danske Bank, the African Development Bank has also offered support for the construction of the Assela wind project by granting US$1.8 million which is to be used for the studies of the environmental and social impact of the farm that located around 150km away from Addis Ababa, on the edge of the Rift Valley in the regional state of Oromia. The wind farm is expected to have 29 turbines with each turbine having the capacity to produce 3.45MW, hence contributing 100MW to the electrical grid of Ethiopia.
