The Lilongwe Water Board (LWB) in Malawi has commissioned its Customer Service Center in Area 25 (B) as one way of bringing services closer to the people. The new LWB Service Center is expected to serve around 250,000 customers from Area 25, 49, 50 and 51. Customers from these four areas have been accessing LWB services at the Kanengo Zone Office which has always been congested in the dimension of customer service.
