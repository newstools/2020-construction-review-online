The Tema Motorway Interchange is to have a police post constructed nearby according to plans set out by the Tema Metropolitan Assembly (TMA). The newly constructed interchange is located in Tema city on the Atlantic coast of Ghana.

Mr. Asante said that the post will have a control tower to help with traffic management and fasten response in case of any road crashes and accidents at the heart of Tema.  He also mentioned that the post is planned to be offering towing services for vehicles that may break down along the route and so on. On his side, Joseph Owusu-Bempah the MTTD Commander and Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) welcomed the idea saying that the project when complete will have a positive impact on traffic in the city. “We have observed that most traffic incidents happen in and around the Tema Motorway Interchange and it is therefore very important and practical that police presence is felt at the place” he explained. In the past the Regional MTTD Command had secured two office accommodations from the Ghana Highway Authority, to serve the same purpose but the building was later demolished in order to make way for the construction of the motorway.  The contractor, therefore, provided a small post for use by the Regional MTTD which even though it served the purpose, was a little bit inconvenient for it did not even have a parking space. ACP Owusu-Bempah said that his department would do whatever there is to do to see to it that the project came into fruition.
