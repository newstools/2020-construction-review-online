Plans for the 8 Conlay mixed-use project at the heart of Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia have been unveiled by KSK Land, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Malaysia’s KSK Group. Situated between the Kuala Lumpur City Centre and the Golden Triangle neighbourhood, the 8 Conlay scheme is designed by RSP Architects while TROP Studio provided the landscapes. The development will feature three towers comprising five-star Kempinski Hotel and two luxury residential towers, created in partnership with the global design group, YOO, known as YOO8 serviced by Kempinski. The building will comprise a Water Lounge on the 26th floor including an oasis of relaxing ripple pools, gymnasium, and stellar city views; and a Green Refuge on the 44th floor.

There is also the choice of à la carte services that range from laundry, housekeeping, to a daycare centre for children,” she said. Kua further added that as the real estate price and consumption taxes are increasing in Japan, YOO8 becomes a golden opportunity for Japanese people who are looking for property investment or planning retirement in Malaysia. “Lower taxes, world-class healthcare, and 1-year Platinum membership to Kempinski Discovery Loyalty Programme are few of the perks that residents can instantly benefit. YOO8 also offers easy application to the MM2H Programme to facilitate the Japanese market, acquiring their dream homes at the vibrant heart of South East Asia’s fastest-growing city,” she affirmed.
