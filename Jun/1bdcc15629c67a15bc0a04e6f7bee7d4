The government of Kenya is to begin funding the construction of the Mombasa-Nairobi expressway in the coming financial year’s budgetary allocation. This is following the allocation of Ksh189b (US$ 1.78b) to the Department of Infrastructure in the coming financial year to cover funding for various infrastructure projects ranging from roads to railways. The Mombasa-Nairobi expressway project is a proposed 4 lane dual carriageway road that will link Nairobi to Mombasa and cut road travel time significantly on the current busy highway. The road will incorporate the option of being increased to a 6 lane highway. KeNHA the government agency in-charge of road construction signed a binding agreement with Betchel International, an American civil engineering and construction company to design, construct, and operate the proposed expressway in 2017. The feasibility study done earlier had indicated that the viability of the project rested in the operator being allowed to charge a toll in order to recover the costs of construction. Other roads to receive funding during the coming year will be the Nairobi-Nakuru-Mau Summit Road and the Kenol-Marua road which is from Thika to Nyeri. The funding of these projects comes in the wake of the government’s efforts to stimulate the economy in the aftermath of the ravages of the corona pandemic.
