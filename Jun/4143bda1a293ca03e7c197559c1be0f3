Faced with business disruption due to the wake of the COVID – 19 shutdown, Barpro Storage SA (Pty) Ltd, South Africa’s most trusted mobile racking and storage specialist, decided to investigate the possible future of what cold & freezer stores could look like within the next 10 years. The concept was directed more to the economic adoption of new features as they are all currently in use & even standard practices globally. The company avoided features specifically around the efficiency of refrigeration plants as this is a specialist area; in which it does not have sufficient experience. However, the features mentioned, when put together, will provide significant energy efficiencies.  “Our dreams will differ from yours. We would hope that our attempts to articulate our dream about cold stores will inspire comments, critical or otherwise, as well as suggestions which we have overlooked. These can then be used to generate a wide range of discussions in upcoming newsletter issues” stated Barpro Storage on a press release. Click here to follow this article in detail.
