The Allston Multibillion-dollar highway project that is projected to be the biggest road construction project in the Boston area and has taken over 10 years in planning has recently received new design plans that will add landmarks to the Allston infrastructure. The state transportation ministers are considering the new design plans along with two other suggestions that were brought forward. The key deadline for the project is approaching and the decision needs to be made soon however details concerning the new design have not been released yet. The Allston Project is a project that is expected to tackle different transportation aims that the state has such as walking paths, rail tracks fro commute and the construction of a highway. However, the project faces a hurdle that is; it is a mere 62 metres away from the Boston river and on the opposite side, there is Boston University. These two obstructions mean that the planned 12 lane highway, walking paths and railway have to be constructed in the most efficient way to maximise the space.
