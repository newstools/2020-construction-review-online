The projects are not only expected to benefit the center of the two communes but also 20 villages and 5 villages surrounding the Guemassa and Mzoudia commune centers respectively. The key objective of the projects is to assist with the expansion of drinking water access in the rural regions of Chichaoua province and make up for the water deficit caused by repeated years of drought in these regions. The two water supply projects in Morocco will be funded by the German Development Bank (KFW), a German state-owned development bank, based in Frankfurt, at a tune of over US$ 1.2M. The institution finances and supports programs and projects that mainly involve public sector players in developing countries and emerging economies, right from their conception and execution to monitoring their success, on behalf of the German Federal Government, and primarily the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). KFWâ€™s goal is to help its partner countries to fight poverty, maintain peace, and protect both the environment and the climate and shape globalization in an appropriate way.
