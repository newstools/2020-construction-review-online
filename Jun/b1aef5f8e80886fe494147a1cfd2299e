Construction activities have commenced at the 4,047 square meters MDXi Data Center site located in the Appolonia City of Ghana. This comes following the successful acquisition of relevant construction and environmental permits for the project by the developer MainOne and the easing of the government-imposed lock-down restriction in the West African country due to the wake of COVID 19 pandemic. The facility is planned to be built and operated in harmony with the same operational standards that are currently maintained at MainOne and West Africa’s largest Tier III certified and only PCI DCSS Data Center, MDXi Lagos, in the neighboring state of Nigeria.
