Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) has selected a joint venture between Jacobs and H. J. Russell & Company to support the US $3bn ‘More MARTA Atlanta’ transit expansion program; the largest expansion in MARTA’s history. The Jacobs-led team will serve as MARTA’s CPMO Supplemental Services Consultant and manage approximately US $700mn in construction spending in the first five years of the Authority’s “More MARTA Atlanta” expansion project. According to Jacobs People & Places Solutions Senior Vice President and Regional Director Tom Meinhart, for more than 40 years, the City of Atlanta and Clayton, DeKalb and Fulton counties have invested in transit in the Atlanta region. “This contract symbolizes a renewed commitment to that investment and is an historic win, not only for the joint venture team, but for the Atlanta region,” he added.
