The 1,897km Keystone XL pipeline will supply crude from the Alberta oil sands in Canada to the US Gulf Coast refineries. Capable of delivering 830,000 barrels of heavy crude oil a day, the cross-border crude oil pipeline will originate from an oil terminal at Hardisty, Alberta, and traverse through Montana and South Dakota to connect with the existing Keystone Pipeline system at Steele City, Nebraska.
