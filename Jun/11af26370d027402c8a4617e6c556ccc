Construction of Saint-Denis Pleyel station in Northern Paris, France is still on schedule and is expected to be complete in 2024. As part of Paris’s plans to renovate and expand its current transportation network, Kengo Kuma and Associates was awarded a contract to design the Saint-Denis Pleyel Emblematic Train Station. “The first stone of a future global urban project in the site of Saint-Denis Pleyel”. The station is composed of several subsequent spaces that form the main body, surrounded by spaces that complement the purpose of the building being a terminal. It will have nine levels, four of them below ground. Its total area will be 34,000 m². For the purpose proper lighting and ventilation, the design is flooded with daylight, naturally ventilated, and well integrated with its surroundings. The elevations are largely transcendent, and the project is divided into two separated sections in order to provide natural light and breeze even to the lower basements. The whole project will take 53 months, 10 of which will involve mobilisation to prepare for coordination (synthesis) with both the civil engineering works and the equipment works packages (rails, catenary, etc.) already being implemented by the consortium Eiffage, Razel-Bec and TSO.
