Traffic along Waiyaki Way will be disrupted and diverted between September 26 and April 1, 2021, in a bid to facilitate the ongoing construction of the Nairobi Expressway. This is according to a statement released by Peter Mundinia, the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) director-general. Mundinia said that Waiyaki Way from Goodman Towers opposite St Marks Anglican Church to Sanlam Towers some 500 meters away will be closed completely while they pull down the St Mark’s footbridge.

Pedestrians are advised to use designated pedestrian crossing in front of Park Inn Hotel,” explained the KeNHA director-general. The disruption will also affect some sections of Mombasa Road and Uhuru Highway within the same period. The 27km highway that starts at Mlolongo, connects the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) to the city center and terminates at James Gichuru Road in Westlands. It will have a four-lane and six-lane dual carriageway within the existing median of Mombasa Road, Uhuru Highway, and Waiyaki Way as well as 10 interchanges. The section between the Eastern and Southern bypasses will be a six-lane dual carriageway while the section from to the Eastern Bypass and that from the Southern Bypass to James Gichuru will be a four-lane dual carriageway. The elevated highway will begin near Ole Sereni Hotel and run through the CBD along the Uhuru highway up to the James Gichuru junction. Haile Selassie Road, Kenyatta Avenue, and University Way will be below the elevated road. The construction of the Expressway has started, signaling a possible end to traffic jams in the Nairobi metropolitan. Excavators, rollers, graders, loaders, and bulldozers are busy doing preliminary groundwork on the area.
