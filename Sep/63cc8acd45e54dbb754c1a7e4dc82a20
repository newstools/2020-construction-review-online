Strabag Rail is set to upgrade 9.6km section of track from Dětmarovice-Polish border in the Czech Republic. This is after the Strabag subsidiary was awarded the US $125.5m contract by the Czech railway infrastructure authority Správa železnic. Under the contract, the team will modernise an approximately 9.6km long section of track with six-level crossings from Dětmarovice to Petrovice u Karviné on the state border with Poland. The consortium will be responsible for substructure restoration and track renewal. It will also upgrade and install platforms with barrier-free access and renovate bridge structures including the replacement of the technical infrastructure including safety, signalling and power installations, electric switch heating, lighting and overhead lines.
