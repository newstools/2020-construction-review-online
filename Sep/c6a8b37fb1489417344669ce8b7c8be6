The ongoing construction works of Thwake Multipurpose dam project at the confluence of river Thwake and Athi river in the Eastern region of Kenya are reportedly on course and within the required completion timeline. According to the East African country government officials, the project’s construction works are over 37 percent complete and the pending succession disputes with people affected by the project have been resolved. Plans to ensure that the contractor, China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC), is paid in good time have also been laid out as well to enable the successful and timely completion of the project. The Thwake Multipurpose dam project is being implemented in four phases. The first phase, which is currently under execution, involves the construction of an 80.5m high multi-purpose dam with a storage capacity of 688 million cubic meters and associated preliminary works needed to enable the undertaking of the other three phases.

The fourth and the last phase of the project will involve the development of irrigation works for up to 40,075 hectares of land in Kitui and Makueni counties. Funded jointly by the Government of Kenya and the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Thwake Multipurpose Dam project has been cited as a key enabler for the realization of the GOK’s Big 4 Agenda and Vision 2030 blueprint. Upon completion, the project is expected to benefit close to over 1.3 million rural inhabitants of the three counties that it is situated in proximity to.
