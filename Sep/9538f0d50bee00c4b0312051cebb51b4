Chilembene drinking water plant located in Chilembene administrative post, in the southern province of Gaza, Mozambique, has been put back into service by the Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi following the completion of its rehabilitation exercise. Funded by the government of the southern Africa country to a tune of about US$ 2.1M, the upgrade work on the government’s Water Supply Investment and Assets Fund (FIPAG) owned water facility began in February last year as a part of the presidential initiative “Water for Life” (PRAVIDA) which aims to set up water supply facilities capable of producing 1.2 million m3 per day for the benefit of more than one million people in several regions of Mozambique. The improvement exercise on the Chilembene drinking water plant has dramatically increased the amount of water available to the population of Chilembene, raising the system’s distribution capacity from 80 to 4,300 cubic meters of water a day.

When it reaches its full capacity the Chilembene drinking water plant will be able to provide water for 32,000 people. According to the authorities, the rehabilitated drinking water treatment plant will operate 24 hours a day and not 15 hours a day as before. During the inauguration ceremony, President Filipe Nyusi said that Chilembene is growing and its growth should be accompanied by support infrastructures such as good quality water, abundant and good quality electricity, and roads. He also urged the Chilembene public to look after the water system. “Don’t vandalize the tubing and even when the water is close to us, we have to consume it rationally. Water has costs,” declared the president.
