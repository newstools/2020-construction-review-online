The entire project is expected to take approximately six months to complete. PS Kihalangwa affirmed that he personally visited the site and that the project is so far going on well. The project is a result of instructions by the president of the Republic of Kenya His Excellency Uhuru Kenyatta sometime early this year. The president was speaking during a tour to the region where he held a meeting in the facility. He said that it was a shame that the stadium, which lacked adequate facilities couldn’t be used by athletes, especially during rainy seasons. He, therefore, ordered that money be allocated for the stadium for repair work to start within the shortest time possible.
