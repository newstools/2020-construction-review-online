Prefab steel Structure workshop buildings are used for industrial production in which all steel structures are painted and then delivered to the project site for installation. And because the steel structure can be manufactured in the factory and installed on-site, the construction time is significantly reduced. Due to the steel it can dramatically reduce construction waste and is more environmentally friendly. Therefore, it widely used in industrial buildings and civil buildings. Column and roof beam
The columns and roof beams of the steel structure workshop are generally assembled and welded with hot-rolled H section steel or steel plates. The manufacturing accuracy of the H beam, which made of hot-rolled steel, is easy to control. The columns welded from steel plates need correcting after assembly and welding, which can prevent distortion of H section steel due to welding deformation. Secondary Frame
1. Purlin: Purlins made of C-shaped and Z-shaped steel.
The purlins used to support the roof and wall panels and transfer the load from the roof and wall panel to the primary steel frame.
2. Bracing
There are roof bracings and wall bracings. The bracings usually made of steel rod, L angle, or square tube. The bracing system uses to stabilize the steel frame.
3. Sag rod
The sag rod is to link between the two purlins to adjust and control the stability of two adjacent purlins. Generally, sag rod made of rod with a diameter of 12 or 14mm. Portal steel frame
The portal is a traditional structural system. The upper primary frame of the type of structure includes rigid frame beams and columns, bracing, purlins, tie rods, wall girt, etc.
The steel structure portal frame is a branch of the light steel structure. The characteristics of the structure:
1). Reflect the characteristics of lightweight, speed, and efficiency of the light steel structure. It applies new energy-saving and environmentally friendly building materials.
2). Realize factory processing and production, on-site construction, and assembly. Convenient and fast, save the construction period.
3). The structure is sturdy and durable, the price is reasonable, and the economic benefits are obvious.
4). The size of the column distance is free and flexible. It can meet the construction and use requirements under different climatic and environmental conditions. The main application range of the steel structure portal frame includes steel structure workshop, metal warehouse building, industrial shed, aircraft hangar, etc The wall and roof panel divided into two types: corrugated single color sheet and sandwich panel.
The single color metal sheet is used for buildings without heat preservation and heat insulation requirements. Sandwich panels mainly apply for the buildings with the requirement of thermal insulation. The core materials of sandwich panels include foam, glass wool, rock wool, and polyurethane.
The other is the corrugated single color sheet with glass wool roll, which compounded on site.
The role of roof and wall enclosure structure:
1ï¼‰Purlins and girt are necessary frameworks, which are combined with metal cladding to form roof and wall.
2) Transmit horizontal force together with the bracing system and stabilize the overall building. The main types of purlin and wall girt are C-type or Z-type, and the size of the section shall determine after the force calculation. Compared with the Z-shaped cross-section, the mechanical properties of the C type are quite different. The Z-type purlin erected in overlapped, so it is a continuous beam. And the maximum distance between the purlin and the wall girt shall not exceed 1.5 meters. 1). Design:
Design is the source of all procedures. Intelligent design not only saves costs but also makes construction smoother. 2). Production:
Production is the component of steel structure workshop fabricate according to the designed plan. It included the following steps. (1) Cutting.
The process is for the formal processing of steel components. The quality of the cutting has a direct impact on the next process. If the cutting is not correct, the material may become scrap iron. So it is essential to strengthening the quality control of the process. (2) Fabrication.
It is one of the processes most prone to quality problems. So the sufficient welding strength must apply to ensure the durability of the components. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-112440" src="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steel-structure-fabrication-520x320.jpg" alt="steel structure fabrication" width="520" height="320" srcset="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steel-structure-fabrication-520x320.jpg 520w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steel-structure-fabrication-356x220.jpg 356w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steel-structure-fabrication-50x31.jpg 50w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steel-structure-fabrication-640x394.jpg 640w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/steel-structure-fabrication.jpg 650w" sizes="(max-width: 520px) 100vw, 520px" /> (3) Painting.
This process has a significant impact on the service life of steel structure buildings. A good coating can prevent steel structure from rusting and corrosion for a long time, increasing the service life of the steel structure warehouse. 3). On-site installation:
The process occupies an essential position in the quality of the project and has a more significant impact on the entire steel structure warehouse. 1). Lightweight and high strength.
The prefab steel warehouse is only about 1/2 weight of the reinforced concrete building, which meets the needs of the ample space. There is no column barrier inside, clearspan, and vast internal space. 2). Environmental friendly.
Steel structure materials can recycle, and pollution reduced during construction and dismantling. 3). Fast Installation:
The construction time of the steel structure warehouse building is short. As components are all prefabricated in the factory, and the site only needs to be assembled. It significantly shortens the construction period. 4). Performance:
The prefab steel warehouse is durable and easy to repair, and simple maintenance. 5). Appearance:
The steel structure workshop is beautiful and practical, with simple and smooth lines. The color wall panels are available in various colors, and the walls can also apply for other materials. So it is more flexible. 6). Lower Cost:
The steel structure warehouse has a reasonable cost. Lightweight components can reduce the value of the foundation.
