Mr. Agyepong said that the facility would create employment opportunities in the construction phase and approximately 250 direct and indirect jobs upon completion. Speaking during the sod-cutting ceremony, President Akufo-Addo said that the issue of sanitation was a top priority for his government, which is why the Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources (MSWR) which is led by Mrs. Cecilia Abena Daapah was created. The Minister, present in the ceremony said that her ministry constantly engages the Environmental Service Providers Association (ESPA) in ways that waste can be put to good use. She said that research carried out in 2017 showed that Ghana generates five million tonnes of refuse a day of which 60% can be turned into organic waste while another 80% can be recycled into plastics and other products for reuse. The president affirmed that the country would be able to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SGGs) 6, 3, 8, 11, and 13 with the construction of waste treatment plants in all the 16 regions. The Western North plant brings the total number of waste treatment facilities to five in various regions of the West African country.
