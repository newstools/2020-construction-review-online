The government made its intention known after an assessment tour of the ongoing work on the road by the state infrastructure and project monitoring committee, headed by the Chief Of Staff to the government house, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe. During the project tour, the committee noted that only about five percent of work has been achieved since the contractor, Dantata and Sowoe construction company, was awarded the contract in February this year. The project manager of the company, Ibrahim Fahir explained to the committee that apart from the heavy rains, the attitude of these vehicles drivers and the volume of traffic are largely responsible for the slow pace of the work on this project. He said that unless something urgent is done to check the activities of these vehicles, it will be difficult to deliver the project within the scheduled time frame which is 18 months. The Chairman of the committee, Ibrahim Balarabe who expressed displeasure over the development, therefore, said that the government has no other choice than to close the road to trailers, trucks, and other articulated vehicles in order to allow the contractor to speed up the reconstruction works. “We are under intense pressure from the public over the deplorable condition of the road and will therefore do everything possible to ensure the timely completion of the road,” disclosed Mr. Balarabe. He also appealed to the federal government to repair some of the federal roads in the state including the Mokwa-Tegina-Brinin Gwari highway, and the Bida-Lapai-Agaie-Lambata highway to reduce the pressure on the Minna-Bida road.
