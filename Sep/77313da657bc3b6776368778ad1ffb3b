Clariant has announced the construction of a new high-tech catalyst production site in Zhejiang, China. This project represents a significant investment which further strengthens Clariant’s position in China and enhances its ability to support its customers in the country’s thriving petrochemicals industry. The new facility will be primarily responsible for producing the CATOFIN catalyst for propane dehydrogenation, which is used in the production of olefins such as propylene. Thanks to its excellent reliability and productivity, CATOFIN delivers superior annual production output compared to alternative technologies, resulting in increased overall profitability for propylene producers. Construction at the Dushan Port Economic Development Zone in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province is scheduled to commence in Q3 2020, and Clariant expects to be at full production capacity by 2022.

Once completed, it will be Clariant’s third catalyst production plant in China. It will strengthen Catalyst’s existing network, which comprises a joint venture facility with the North Huajin Group in Panjin as well as a fully-owned Clariant facility in Jinshan, Shanghai. China is the world’s leading producer of on-purpose propylene. The nation’s production volume accounts for around 50% of total global capacity and is expected to continue rising by 8% annually. Consequently, the first phase of the new plant will focus on meeting China’s PDH requirements through CATOFIN production. In the future, Clariant may expand manufacturing capabilities at the site to offer further catalyst technologies relevant to China’s chemical industry.
