The system is based on groundwater obtained from boreholes and supplies water only to the Wenchi Municipality. An assessment carried out by the Ghana Water Co. Ltd. indicated the poor state of the existing system, and the recommendation was for a new Water Supply System that will obtain water from freshwater sources, ensure continuity of water supply, and meet the ever-increasing demand for water in the region. To execute this project, the Akufo-Addo government has secured over US$ 35M credit facility from Belfius Bank of Belgium, with the support of the Belgian Export Credit Agency, Credendo. During its construction phase, the project is expected to create job opportunities, as the contractor will engage the services of indigenous people. Upon completion in 36 months’ time, the project will have a total supply capacity of 10,700 cubic meters per day. This will be adequate to meet the water needs of an estimated population of 92,500 people in towns such as Wenchi, Droboso, Yoyoano, Beposo, Asuano, Koase, Nkonsia, Wurompo, and Awisa up to the year 2040. Also, according to President Nana Akufo-Addo, once complete the project is expected to make investors take advantage of the government’s Flagship Programmes such as “One- District, One-Factory”. The Wenchi Water Supply Project is in line with the 2016 NPP Manifesto pledge providing “Water for All”.
