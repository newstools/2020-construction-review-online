Construction of US $400m UnCommons, a mixed-use development at Interstate 215 and Durango Drive in southwest Las Vegas, US has begun. The 40 acre project which is being developed in phases, will feature office, residential and lifestyle space. Phase I is scheduled for completion in early 2022. UnCommons captures the latest thinking in workplace design and the right benefits to enhance productivity. Modern office space with inspired food, fitness and retail options are woven throughout a campus-like utopia midway between Henderson and Summerlin. The development will comprise more than 500,000ft2 of modern office space, 830+ residential units, a beer garden, restaurants and cafes, health and fitness studios, a multi-purpose conference centre, a pedestrian trail and public art.

He further added that they are hopeful that when complete, the intention and thoughtfulness that inspired the work at UnCommons will deliver great design, as well as respond to the needs of our community. Gensler UnCommons principal in charge Darrel Fullbright said that they have pushed through many long hours over the last several months adjusting the UnCommons plan to capture the best practices for the modern workplace in a post pandemic world. “We are entering a new phase of shifted priorities where employee heath, wellness and safety will be the standard going forward,” he added.
