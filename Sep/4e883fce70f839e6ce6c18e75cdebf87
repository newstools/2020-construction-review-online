A power purchase agreement (PPA) for the proposed Gabès photovoltaic solar project in Tunisia has been signed between the Tunisian Electricity and Gas Company (Steg), and the project developer, a consortium formed by Akuo Energy, an independent power producer (IPP) based in Paris, France; HBG Holding, a subsidiary of Hédi Bouchamaoui Group; and Nour Energy, a subsidiary of the Chaabane real estate group. According to the agreement, upon completion, the 10 MWp Gabès photovoltaic solar project with the capacity to produce 23 GWh per year; a quantity of electricity that could supply 14,000 households in the governorate of Gabès in the south-east of Tunisia, will sell electricity to the state through the Steg at a cost of 39.6 euros per MWh for a period of 20 years.

The consortium hopes to complete the financing of its solar power plant by next year in order to launch the works which should be completed in 2022. The future facility will be made up of two-sided solar panels placed on trackers, which allow the sun’s path to be followed for better light capture. The Gabès photovoltaic solar power plant is part of the Tunisian Solar Plan (TSP), implemented by the Tunisian government with the aim of increasing the share of renewable energies in the electricity mix from the current 3% to approximately 30% in the next ten years. Within the framework of the TSP, the Tunisian government plans to build 16 new solar power plants, including six installations with a capacity of 10 MWp each and 10 others with a capacity of 1 MWp.
