IPD has introduced its water pump for the CAT 3500 engine series – this is the first of a number of water and oil pumps due for release by IPD this year. This is the first water pump engineered, manufactured and tested by IPD, and is a result of the demand for a reliable quality part with the market having long experienced many mediocre and sub-standard water pumps that either leaked or otherwise failed. The IPD product is a significant improvement on the water pump #4160610 – previously model #2128177. To achieve this benchmark, IPD set its in-house engineering team to work on a new design. It used the most advanced three-dimensional scanning and coordinate measurement machine (CMM) technologies to create this precision water pump. The unit includes only the highest quality materials and components, with precision-machined cast-iron housings and impellers, as well as steel shafts and bronze thrust washers. Ceramic, spring-loaded water seals are used, with Teflon lip-type hydrodynamic oil seals. IPD, which is committed to being the quality leader in engine pumps, ensures that every pump is carefully inspected and tested for leakage, pressure and flow by the company’s dedicated quality assurance team. Innovative packaging ensures these new pumps arrive in perfect condition. Recyclable plastic caps protect the bearings during shipping and prevent debris from getting inside the pumps. Rather than using the typical shredded cardboard to pack the units, IPD has rigid, custom-fit foam inserts to provide total protection. IPD also plans to launch water pumps for CAT engines in the C15/C18, 3300, C27/C37 and C15 series, as well an auxiliary water pump for the G3300 engine.
