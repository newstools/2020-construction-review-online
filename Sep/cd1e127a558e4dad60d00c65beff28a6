Gold producer, Dallaglio Investments (Pvt) Limited, has announced plans to build over 300 houses in Mashonaland West Province near the group’s Pickstone Peerless Gold Mine in Chegutu area. The initiative is part of the group’s strategy to mine in a manner that is beneficial to the community that it operates in and is in sync with President Mnangagwa’s policy thrust. According to Mr Cornwell Dube, the group human resources manager for Dallaglio Investments, the company is looking into rolling out a low cost employee housing scheme for staff members, which is modelled along the likes of Turf Village by Zimplats. “We seek to partner with our mining pension fund and other mortgage financiers on a beneficial arrangement. We believe by year end we should be able to present our proposal to our board as well as share with our important stakeholders our plans. We are excited by the prospects of the immense benefits that this project will bring to both our valued employees and the communities surrounding us,” he added.
