Henkel Adhesive Technologies has broken ground on a new, state-of-the-art production area for UV-curable acrylic pressure sensitive adhesives (PSA) at the site in Salisbury, North Carolina. The new facility is expected to be operational by the end of 2021. This expansion of Henkel’s existing site broadens the company’s capabilities to provide more sustainable and innovative pressure sensitive adhesive solutions to the tape, label, medical, and graphic films markets. UV-curable hot melt adhesives address changing market needs and enhance the customer experience. They are designed to coat a variety of facestocks, serving all segments of traditional pressure sensitive markets. Branded as Loctite Durotak UV, Henkel will offer a comprehensive set of adhesive chemistries from this new facility, including pure polymer, formulated free radical, and cationic curing systems. Unique to Henkel, cationic cured UV PSAs utilize a novel curing page 2/3 mechanism, allowing for lower energy consumption and through-cure of extremely high coat weights (double to triple that of traditional free radical systems).

We remain focused on enhancing the consumer experience bringing real value to our customers and their brands,” said Gary Rzonca, Vice President, Packaging & Consumer Goods, North America.
