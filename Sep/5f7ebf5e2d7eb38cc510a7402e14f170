It is also the longest and the largest line in the Middle East region according to Sherif Nazmy, the CEO and managing director of Samcrete. “The project is a major turning point for Egypt as it now joins the list of countries using express trains, thus completing the big boom in the transportation sector and the infrastructure and development projects that President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi started,” explained Nazmy. This project is also considered to be a second “Suez Canal” because it connects the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea in a three-hour trip, accelerating the pace of development by transporting passengers and goods. The Samcrete CEO and managing director also revealed that an agreement is in place with the Chinese partner to jointly build a factory in east Port Said to manufacture train coaches and transfer technology and know-how to Egypt and her citizens.
