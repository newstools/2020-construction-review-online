Construction of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA)‘s Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) Desalination Plant at the Jebel Ali Power Plant and Desalination Complex is 79% complete and making significant progress. Wherein the project main buildings are at finishing stage. Most of the marine works are complete and the commissioning works started, especially after the successful operation of the first main power transformer. The new SWRO plant and its associated facilities is being developed to include an advanced pre-treatment, double -pass reverse osmosis SWRO technology, post-treatment process and storage facilities that are connected to the water network. The plant is scheduled for operation in Q1 2021 to meet the reserve margin criterion set for peak water demand for 2021 and beyond. The plant will have a total production capacity of 40 Million Imperial Gallons per Day (MIGD). Jebel Ali Power Plant and Desalination Complex is one of the main complexes providing Dubai with reliable, efficient, and high-quality electricity and water services.

This project supports DEWA’s decoupling of water production and power generation by using electricity generated from solar power for desalination using SWRO technology. These big solar projects launched by DEWA achieved several times the lowest Levelized Cost of solar power globally and contributed in reducing the global costs of generating electricity from solar power.
