FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies has held a virtual ground-breaking ceremony to signal the start of its Advanced Therapies Innovation Center construction project. The US $55m  building is part of previously announced investments by FUJIFILM Corporation. The 60,000 square foot building will house dedicated process development and innovation laboratories to support advanced therapy projects. The building will be part of a 22-acre land parcel acquired by FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies from Lake Walk in June 2020. The laboratories will have BSL-2 capabilities with state-of-the-art upstream, downstream and analytical development technologies. The building will triple the sites’ advanced therapies process development capabilities. It is expected that this new building will bring approximately 100 jobs to the College Station area.
