The conference for architects and construction industry professionals will take place online from 28 September to 2 October 2020. Save the date: Tony Brown’s webinar on 1 October, “The Evolving Built Environment RENOLIT ALKORPLAN Single Ply Waterproofing Adapting to change…” Sant Celoni, Barcelona, 24 September 2020 – Specialists in manufacturing membranes for waterproofing roofs and coverings, like the well-known RENOLIT ALKORPLAN family, RENOLIT is an official sponsor of RIAS Convention 2020: WITH THE GRAIN. This online event will bring together architects, construction industry professionals and the public to discuss sustainable design, remodelling existing buildings and explore innovative architectural solutions with low environmental impact. From 28 September to 2 October, conference speakers will share their ideas. Among the speakers will be Tony Brown, National Technical Manager of RENOLIT ALKORPLAN, with his talk entitled “The Evolving Environment RENOLIT ALKORPLAN Single Ply Waterproofing Adapting to change…” which will take place live on the 1st of October from 1.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. “We are proud to be a sponsorship partner of the RIAS Convention and to work alongside RIAS, currently the most important architectural institute in Scotland, with over 5,200 members actively searching for eco-friendly design solutions and solid integration between architectural and natural elements. RENOLIT ALKORPLAN also wishes to offer its valuable contribution to designers, by presenting efficient technical solutions that can adapt to the sudden changes in our contemporary world, especially in terms of climate and environment.”  Says Tony Brown The challenge today is to build a more sustainable world. To search for new raw materials and create unique and innovative technologies that make it possible to produce more, using fewer resources. These are the cornerstones of the RENOLIT webinar, illustrating how the waterproof membranes in the RENOLIT ALKORPLAN family are solutions that fully satisfy current building regulations and government guidelines. The European Union is currently launching an important initiative to define, test and perfect the best methodology for measuring the environmental footprint of a product (PEF) and of the organisations that manufacture it (OEF). What are the elements that need to be considered to contribute tangibly to better sustainability? To make sure that human beings do not consume more resources than those the Earth has to offer. A simple concept, but one that is quite complex to put into practice. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-112240" src="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4-427x320.png" alt="" width="427" height="320" srcset="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4-427x320.png 427w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4-696x522.png 696w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4-560x420.png 560w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4-80x60.png 80w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4-265x198.png 265w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4-640x480.png 640w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download-4.png 700w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /> The way in which raw materials are managed, stored and protected is certainly a valuable contribution to the general sustainability profile of a product. Other important factors are the longer life cycle of the solution, elimination of the use of hazardous substances in the design stages and the socio-economic conditions of the workforce. What is more, in this context, technical performance is crucial and includes the concept of circular economy. Does the product encourage its reuse, recycling or regeneration? The RENOLIT ALKORPLAN product family fully meets the characteristics listed above. In fact, these membranes are made with a minimum use of resources, made up of a very small amount of raw materials coming from crude oil and the rest is salt, a substance that is widely available on Earth and has a really low environmental footprint. Unlike other products for waterproofing roofs, which release toxic substances and/or change the pH of water, these PVC membranes also make it possible to collect and reuse rainwater for irrigation. Lastly, the longer the lifecycle of the membrane, the lower the exploitation of resources generated on the planet. This is the reason why the company promotes Cool Roof systems, like RENOLIT ALKORSMART, which is much more sustainable than any other synthetic membrane as it offers a positive ratio between the raw materials used and the yield throughout its lifecycle. So the path being taken is that which heads towards a more inclusive, ethical and fair future, which in RENOLIT ALKORPLAN roofing products is expressed in concrete actions aimed at saving energy, lowering consumption but also investing in technologies and in digitalisation, reducing waste and CO2 emissions caused by road transport. Today, 8,500 tons per year of pre-consumer materials are being recycled by RENOLIT, meaning that +100% of material has been recovered in the past 8 years with 8% of the workforce involved in the processes and the development of the new recycling plant in Sant Celoni. This demonstrates the company’s is commitment to circular economy principles.  What was once considered “waste” is now a “resource”. The RENOLIT Goes Circular initiative aims to improve the efficiency of production processes by avoiding waste and increasing the recovery of waste materials. RENOLIT is excited to sponsor and speak at the RIAS Convention 2020, to confirm its commitment towards innovation and the development of cutting-edge, sustainable products that meet the real needs of professionals in the construction sector.
