The government of Uganda through the Ministry of Local Government has given the contractor for the Masaka Central Market project up to the end of November to complete the construction works and handover the project. This is according to Raphael Magyezi, the East African country minister for Local government who was speaking after inspecting the project which he believes, at the roofing and painting stage, it is way back behind schedule compared to other markets across the country that started around the same time (February 2018).

Funded by African Development Bank and the Ugandan government at a tune of Shs18.4b, the project is being executed by a joint venture made of Multiplex Ltd and Alshams Construction Company Ltd. Mr. Moses Ndege Bbosa, the managing director of Multiplex Ltd, blamed the delay on continued change of designs for the market and the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Just like other people we have been affected by Covid-19 pandemic in addition to the changes in designs, but we promise this time to complete the work by end of November,” he explained. Constructed back in 1936, the old Masaka Central Market structure was pulled down two years ago and it was housing more than 1,000 vendors who currently operate in makeshift stalls adjacent to Masaka Secondary School main gate. Upon completion, the new market is expected to accommodate more than 2,000 vendors. It will have an agro-processing facility, stalls, shops, cold rooms, restaurants, a parking yard, and loading and offloading areas, drainage ways, solid waste bays, firefighting facilities, among others.
