Constructed in the mid-1970s, the iconic structure, which is part of Sharjah’s collective cultural memory, has been restored by the Sharjah Art Foundation to reflect its original architecture. When it reopens, the venue will host the immersive, site-specific multimedia installation Lindsay Seers and Keith Sargent: Nowhere Less Now 3 [flying saucer] (on view until 26 December 2020), which responds to the building’s architecture, as well as a range of learning workshops suitable for children and families and two film screenings.
