A part of the earmarked money will also be used to improve the equipment of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), which is a state-owned authority that owns, operates, and maintains the Suez Canal. With the new plan, the Egyptian authorities hope to increase the capacity of the Suez Canal, which is one of the country’s major sources of income built by the Suez Canal Company between 1859 and 1869 and officially opened on 17 November 1869 but owned by the United Kingdom and France until July 1956, when the then President of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser, nationalized it. This facility is considered as one of the most important links in global supply chains, thanks to its important geographical location as a shipping route. It offers watercraft a more direct route between the North Atlantic and northern Indian oceans via the Mediterranean and Red seas, thus avoiding the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans and reducing the journey distance from the Arabian Sea to London, for example, by approximately 8,900 kilometers. According to Minister El-Said, the canal’s revenues reached about US$5.73bn for FY2018-19, making the area one of Egypt’s main sources of foreign exchange.
