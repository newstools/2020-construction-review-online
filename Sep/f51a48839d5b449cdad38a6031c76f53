Tata Projects, a subsidiary of Indian conglomerate Tata Group, has won a bid to construct the new Indian Parliament building in the capital city of New Delhi at a cost of US $117m. According to the Central Public Works Department (CPWD) the new Parliament building will be built near the current building, which is over 90 years old. The new Parliament building is said to be shaped like a triangle and is expected to include the national emblem of India, which could be placed atop of the new building. Upon completion, the new building is expected to have halls with larger seating capacity for the Lok Sabha (lower house) and the Rajya Sabha (upper house), offices for members of Parliament along with a courtyard, dining facilities and a lounge for lawmakers. The Lok Sabha is likely to have more numbers after the constituencies are reorganised and the present building has no space for the extra Parliamentarians. The new building is expected to accommodate nearly 1,400 Members of Parliament.
