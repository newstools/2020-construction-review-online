Construction of the external structure for the Austria Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai is now complete. The construction process was taking place under the UAE authorities’ health and safety rules for construction sites in Dubai in context of the pandemic. The ground-breaking ceremony on the 2,400 square metre plot that is home to the Austria Pavilion was held in October 2019, and the first of 38 cones that form the pavilion was completed in spring 2020. The cones have a diameter of 7 metres at the base, are between 6 and 15 metres high and intersect one another to form space sequences of varying sizes. A total of 246 prefabricated elements were connected by couplings to form the 38 cones. This will make disassembly after use easy, and will allow reassembly at a different location. According to Austria’s Commissioner General Beatrix Karl, construction of the external structure was phase 1 of the project and phase two will last until the beginning of 2021. “The exhibits, fittings, and furnishings will be installed in plenty of time before the opening,” he added.
