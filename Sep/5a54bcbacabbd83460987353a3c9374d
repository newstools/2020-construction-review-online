Gabon through the state’s motorway company {Société Autoroutière du Gabon (SAG)} has announced the start of the construction works on the “Transgabonaise” road linking Libreville to Franceville via the RN1, RN2, RN3, and the RN4. This comes after the motorway company signed a contract for the implementation of the project with Afcons infrastructure limited, a subsidiary of the Shapoorji Pallonji group, and a global leader in the EPC infrastructure sector. According to a press release by the SAG, the project will be carried out under a Public-Private Partnership model in three phases’ i.e. Libreville – Alembé, Alembé – Mikouyi (through Lalara, Koumameyong, Booué, and Carrefour Leroy), and Mikouyi – Franceville within a span of 18 months. The transgabonaise is the main road that crosses the country from east to west, connecting the large agricultural areas of Gabon. This road, highly strategic for the country, is currently in an advanced state of degradation, making it impossible to move around in acceptable security conditions. The renovation of this road is of crucial importance for the Republic of Gabon in terms of the movement of goods and people.

It will also secure and reduce travel time to link one locality to another, and promote the development of several infrastructures. Furthermore, it will help improve the living conditions of the populations concerned. “We are delighted with the development of this infrastructure project that will connect the large agricultural areas of Gabon to the rest of the country and that will be the base of creation of many jobs to the people of the Central African country,” says Mathieu Peller, CEO Africa of Meridiam and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the SAG.
