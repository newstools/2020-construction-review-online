For a new state-of-the-art waste-to-energy biogas plant in Romania, Landia has been chosen to supply two of its 25m3 pasteurizers.The Landia BioChop units will play a crucial role in eliminating biohazards by heating biomass to a minimum of 72°C for one-hour batch processes – allowing the final digestate to be utilized safely as a high-quality fertilizer. Equipped with a Landia chopper pump and a Landia side-entry mixer, the plug-in-and-play Biochop can treat both slaughterhouse and food waste for flows in excess of 300 tonnes per day. Delivered complete with user-friendly control system for regulation, monitoring and registration of the hygienisation process, the Landia BioChop also benefits from having no moving parts inside the pasteurizers, so there is no need to enter the tank to carry out maintenance. In addition to the externally-mounted chopper pump (that reduces particle sizes) and side-entry propeller mixer, the Landia pasteurizer is also supplied with an integral heating jacket as part of its very solid and compact design for high treatment capacity. In the lower part of the BioChop, the Landia chopper pump ensures comprehensive circulation of the biomass, preventing dead zones in the tank. At the same time, it constantly reduces particle size for optimization of the heating process and the supply of suitably homogenised feedstock for the digesters. The chopper pump can also be used for emptying of the tank – typically achieved in just a few minutes. Meanwhile, the angled, side-entry Landia mixer further enhances movement in the tank, with every unit, including propeller, customised for each specific project.
