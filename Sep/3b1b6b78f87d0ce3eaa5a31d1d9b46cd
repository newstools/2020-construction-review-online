The government of Ivory Coast through the ministry of Hydraulics led by Minister Laurent Tchagba has commissioned two water tower projects in the West African country, particularly in the villages of Boussoukro and Bouaffoukro, located in the region of Moronou. Constructed at a cost of approximately 519,500 euros, the first facility in Boussoukro has a storage capacity of about 80m3 of water at a height of approximately 12 m. This will supply drinking water to the populations of Boussoukro and three of its surrounding villages, which are Offa, Kodimasso and Bodo. Its construction was entirely financed by the Ivorian government.

The Ivorian Minister of Hydraulics also inaugurated the construction of the first-ever water tower in the Division of Assahara, in the Moronou region. At a height of 15 m, the projected will have a storage capacity of about 200 m3. It is expected to be operational within a span of six months. It will supply drinking water to up to 12,300 inhabitants of Assahara, as well as certain surrounding localities, notably N’Drikro, Komambo, Assieboussou, Kouama, and Kouakro. The project is estimated to cost 844,600 euros or its whereabouts. All these projects are a part of the government’s plan to enable the entire population of the West African country to have access to clean drinking water by 2030.
