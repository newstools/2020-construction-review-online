A 20MWp solar power plant is set to be built at Blanket gold mine in Zimbabwe by Canadian mining operator Caledonia Mining Corporation. This is after the company obtained US $13m through the sale of 597,963 shares in a market offer (MBO) for the construction of the project which will be carried out on a 40-hectare site. The plant is intended to offset load shedding due to deficiencies in Zimbabweâ€™s national electricity distribution network.

The company already advertised tenders for the implementation of the project late last year under an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract.
