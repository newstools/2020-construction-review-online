This power plant and several others currently under construction, have put the North West province on the map as a player in the renewable energy sector, to not only deliver additional power to the country’s national grid but also benefit the rural communities through impactful economic development programs. Reportedly, over 450 people from the local beneficiary communities were directly employed on the project during the phase of construction which commenced in November 2018. This is in addition to the income opportunities created through the contracting out of various services. Furthermore, during its 20-year operations, the project is expected to benefit a large number of communities, spread within a 50km radius of the project site, through various socio-economic development projects focused on education, youth development, health, food security, and welfare. Additionally, a percentage of the revenue generated each year will be committed to implementing small and micro-enterprise development initiatives to build resilience and accelerate the growth and success of entrepreneurial businesses subsequently stimulating the local economic growth and creating opportunities for the economic participation of previously disadvantaged groups. Bokamoso Solar power plant is developed by a consortium made up of IDEAS Fund, Old Mutual (SA), Reatile Solar Power, Phakwe Solar, Business Venture Investments 1984 and Cicada Community Trust.
