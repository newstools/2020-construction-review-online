Dogger Bank wind farm and GE Renewable Energy have announced new contracts confirming for the 13MW Haliade-X turbine to be delivered for the Dogger Bank A and Dogger Bank B phases of the world’s largest offshore windfarm. The contract includes an order for 190 Haliade-X 13MW offshore wind turbines to be installed off the north-east coast of England, split evenly at 95 turbines for each of the first two phases of Dogger Bank Wind Farm. The  13MW Haliade-X will be installed in the turbines for the first time ever in the world. One spin of the Haliade-X 13MW can generate enough electricity to power a household in the United Kingdom for over two days. Also Read: 450MW offshore wind farm to be built in Adriatic Sea in Italy. As part of the agreement GE Renewable Energy will establish its marshaling harbor activities at Able Seaton Port in Hartlepool which will serve as the base for turbine service equipment, installation, and commissioning activities for Dogger Bank A and B. This will see the delivery of component parts for each of GE’s Haliade-X 13MW wind turbines to the specialist port, including the nacelle, three tower sections, and three 107m long blades, for pre-assembly on-site at Able Seaton prior to transport out to the North Sea for installation. This activity will lead to the creation of 120 skilled jobs at the port during construction at what will be the world’s largest offshore windfarm. This brings the total number of jobs in the North East associated with the development and operation of Dogger Bank Wind Farm to 320 so far. The turbine installation is expected to commence in 2023 at Dogger Bank A. Recruitment activity is expected to begin in early 2021, and job roles will be advertised closer to the time by GE and by Dogger Bank via the Dogger Bank website and social media channels.
