The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) has selected Fugro to provide site characterisation services in support of a US $250m highway improvement project near Dallas in US. Fugro is delivering their services under a 5-year (2019-2024) indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract (IDIQ) for TxDOT and this is the first work authorisation issued under the IDIQ. Fugro’s final deliverables for this important infrastructure project are scheduled for March 2021. With a goal of decreasing congestion and improving safety at the interchange of US Highway 80 and Interstate Highway 635, the TxDOT highway improvement project requires multiple new and reconstructed bridges, retaining structures, noise walls, traffic lanes and frontage roads, in addition to reconstructing the existing interchange.

To expedite data collection, Fugro is using drilling rigs that can acquire both soil and pavement samples from the same machine. This specialised technology increases efficiency and minimises traffic disruption in the work area. Laboratory testing of selected soil and rock samples will be performed at Fugro’s Dallas facility to evaluate the strength and compressibility characteristics of the subsurface materials. Fugro will also perform geotechnical analysis and provide engineering recommendations for constructing the more than 75 retaining walls required by the project.
