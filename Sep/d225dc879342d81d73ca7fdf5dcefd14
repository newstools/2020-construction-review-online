This translates to more clean energy, growth, and productivity in Cote d’Ivoire” explained the Petroci Director-General during the signing of the agreement. The proposed facility is expected to increase the country’s LPG storage capacity by 60% and significantly enhance importation, storage, supply, and distribution of LPG and other related activities in Cote d’Ivoire and its neighboring nations such as the republics of Mali, Burkina Faso, and Guinea. The project will also bridge the current product supply and storage gap in the market and ensure more product availability and security by increasing stock holding from 15 days to approximately 27 days.
