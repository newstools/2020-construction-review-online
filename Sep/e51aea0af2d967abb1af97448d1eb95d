The construction of the Magdi Yacoub Global Heart Centre, a new 300-bed hospital that aims to provide state-of-the-art treatment for local and international patients in Cairo, Egypt, has begun. Designed by International architecture firm Foster + Partners the hospital is reportedly meant to respond to the needs of patients, their families, and the staff that care for them, and is set within a lush, verdant landscape and a calming lake that seeks to optimize the overall patient experience and decrease recovery times. The project is basically a series of medical buildings surrounded by greenery and fitted with serial window bays facing a view that includes the Great Pyramids of Giza. The ground floor of the project includes diagnosis and treatment areas as well as an emergency area, outpatient clinic, and rehabilitation clinics.

This arrangement will allow doctors, researchers, and caregivers to communicate and collaborate more easily. The upper-level terrace contains outdoor spaces for staff and patients, as well as a canteen, a children’s nursery, and meeting spaces for doctors and other workers. Founded under the Magdi Yacoub Global Heart Foundation by Sir Magdi Yacoub, a surgeon who has outlined a vision for offering free vital health services for low and middle-income people across Africa, the future Magdi Yacoub Global Heart Centre is not only expected to add more beds to the foundations’ health network but also expand the scale of its research and training programs. Furthermore, it will allow the foundation to improve its connectedness to other countries, provide better access to care, and increase opportunities for medical and research collaboration.
