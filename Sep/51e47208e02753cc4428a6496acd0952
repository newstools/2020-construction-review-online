Phase two of the project will be completed next year according to Maryam Bello, the Group Head of City Project. The company expressed its determination to close the housing gap in the country. Mr. Muktari Musa the Brains and Hammers city project director said that the vision of developing a city was hinged on the need to play a pivotal role in addressing the estimated over 17 million housing deficit in Nigeria. “With an estimated 700 houses needed per year, it is evident that the government alone cannot meet the housing needs of Nigerians. That is why Brains and Hammers took the bold initiative to embark on this project” explained Mr. Muktari Musa. The project was conceived as a self-sustaining and affordable housing project designed to cater to the housing needs of middle and low-income earners. “There is also the possibility of a mortgage payment plan for some persons, especially those who have an account with the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN)” confirmed Maryam Bello.
