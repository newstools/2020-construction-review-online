Construction of the US $1.3bn Vancouver Broadway Subway in British Colombia, Canada is set to start. This is after the Broadway Subway Project Corporation, formed by Ghella and the Spanish firm ACCIONA, reached financial close to build the Broadway Subway Project, an extension of the Millennium Line and a key link for the Vancouver transit system. Using a design-build-finance approach, includes the design and construction of 5.7 new kilometres of network, part of which will be underground twin tunnels with an excavation diameter of 6.3 metres and six new stations.

Once in service, the trip from VCC-Clark to Arbutus Station will take 11 minutes, saving the average transit commuter almost 30 minutes a day and relieving congestion along Broadway. This will significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions: a sustainable solution that will benefit the whole Vancouver community. The project is funded and delivered by the Government of British Columbia, with contributions from the Government of Canada and the City of Vancouver. The Broadway Subway Project Corporationselected by the Province of British Columbia is led by ACCIONA (60%) and Ghella (40%). The companies have already collaborated in the past in iconic international transport tunnelling infrastructures such as Scandinavia’s longest high-speed railway tunnels for the Norwegian railway authorities (the Follo Line), the Legacy Way highway tunnels in Brisbane (Australia) and the Bologna Node on the Milan-Naples high-speed rail section in Italy.
