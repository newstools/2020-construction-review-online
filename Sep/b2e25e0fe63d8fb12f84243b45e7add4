The government of Uganda through the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) has given the contractor undertaking the John Babiiha Avenue construction works a go-ahead to work day and night so as to achieve delivery of substantial works by December this year. The Avenue structural Engineer Moses Gimeyi says that they are currently mobilizing the main requirement, which is illuminations to light the road before night works kickoff. On the other hand, David Mugurusi, the safety manager at the site says they are also working on the security of the team especially those who will be working in small numbers at isolated spots.

Stephen Kibuuka, the KCCA Project Coordinator, the entity expects the carriageway, the walkway, and drainage system to be fully constructed and the road operational within the next three months. Works at the avenue that is also known as Acacia Avenue, started in May last year and were expected to be complete in 15 months’ time, which is by August 2020. However, the heavy rains experienced last year followed by the wake of the COVID 19 pandemic has according to the contractor affected the implementation of the World Bank-funded project under the Kampala Institutional Infrastructure Development Project. The contractor is still working on the drainage system and construction of the box culvert at the golf club whose construction is close to completion. They have also laid pipes in the culvert and are now finishing works on the side of the culvert. Furthermore, they have created a diversion from Metropole Hotel to Kabojja Junior School as works kick off on the Carriage Way. Upon completion, John Babiiha Avenue will be made up of four lanes with signal junctions including one at the first junction coming from Golf Club, then at the second Junction at Kabojja Junior School junction and the junction at Kira Road.
