The government of Ghana plans to begin the construction of Keta seaport early next year. This was confirmed by Kwaku Ofori Asiamah, the West African country minister of transport when addressing the Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Asiamah said that the feasibility studies for the project are progressing well and are expected to be complete by the third month of 2021. The studies are being carried out by a consortium that comprises ProTeln Service GmbH, PSP Architekten, Ingenieure, and the Ghanaian Yogarib Engineering Services Limited, all of which are headed by Sellhorn Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH. In addition to the feasibility studies, the consortium will also provide a master plan, including development and investment strategy for the project.

Fast forward in March 2019, the government appointed Alexander Adusei as the general manager of the future port, and a site for the construction of the facility was selected on the Atlantic coast, on the border with Togo. In February this year, the Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority advertised a tender for the feasibility studies and selected the above-mentioned consultants who begun work in April with the first feasibility indicators expected within a  period of seven months. The future seaport of Keta is expected to become Ghana’s third port platform after those of Tema (Accra) and Takoradi. Once operational, in addition to jobs, the facility will offer new opportunities for the Ghanaian port industry. It will also be a privileged gateway for neighboring landlocked countries, including Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali.
