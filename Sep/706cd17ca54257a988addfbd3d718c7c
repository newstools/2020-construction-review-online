Lindt, a world-renown truffle making company has officially launched the Lindt Home of Chocolate, the world’s largest chocolate museum, in Zurich. Inside the 65,000-square-foot museum is the massive 30-foot tall fountain, the world’s largest chocolate fountain that was just recently erected. At the top of the structure is a giant whisk dripping down 1,500 liters of real, melted chocolate into a Lindor candy sculpture. The massive fountain weighs three tons, while chocolate flows out of it at one liter per second. That means it requires 308 feet of pipes inside to function. The commitment to the craft is real here.

At the 1,640-square-foot gift shop, you can even customize your own pralines or have a Lindt Master Chocolatier create a personalized chocolate bar for you. “With the construction of the Lindt Home of Chocolate, we have created a Chocolate Competence Center that is unique in Switzerland and will strengthen the innovation of our industry over the long term, Ernst Tanner, president of the Lindt Chocolate Competence Foundation’s Board, said in a statement.
