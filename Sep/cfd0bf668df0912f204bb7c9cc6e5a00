He said that some of the facilities installed in the airport needed modernization and upgrading. He particularly suggested the provision of fast, free internet connectivity within lounges at the airport, explaining that the era of passengers sitting for long without internet access is long gone. He insisted that the functionality of the Lagos Murtala Muhammed International Airport (LOS) must be fully explored, and urged the management to invest in facilities that would drive more passenger traffic to the airfield. “The Murtala Mohammed International Airport is an important asset, not only to the Federal Government but also to Lagos State. The strategic use of this airport should necessitate that need for us to fully harness the asset and make it a bubbling destination” emphasized the governor.
