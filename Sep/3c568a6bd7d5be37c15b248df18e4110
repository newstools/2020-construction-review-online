The electricity generated from the solar power plant will be connected on the 11kV side of the dedicated 33/11kV substation within Appolonia City from where it will then be distributed to the homes and industrial clients through City’s electricity distribution network. Currently, Appolonia City receives electricity supply from the national grid via a 33kv overhead line, serving a dedicated 60MVA primary substation. Appolonia City CEO Mr. Bright Owusu-Amofah said that this project is good news for the industrial and residential owners in the mixed-use and mixed-income urban development. “One of our objectives is to provide world-class utility services to our residents, and solar power will boost the existing reliable power supply within the city, present superior value to our residents, and underpin our renewable energy strategy” explained Mr. Owusu-Amofah.
