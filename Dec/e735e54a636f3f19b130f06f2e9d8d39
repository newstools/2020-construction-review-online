The new buildings include 235 patient beds in total, and co-locate education and clinical programs to create collaborative opportunities for knowledge exchange, discovery, and learning. The buildings also feature common areas that reduce stress through art and nature. Community integration is encouraged through street-level retail and green space improvements. The new inpatient rooms are infused with natural light and provide a safe space for patients to heal. The opening of these two buildings marks the completion of the third phase of CAMH’s redevelopment project (Phase 1C). This phase of CAMH’s redevelopment adds approximately 650,000 square feet of new space.

In the midst of the current mental health crisis in our society, we’re proud to be part of the solution that connects people struggling with mental health with a safe place for care and education,” he added. Dr. Catherine Zahn, president and CEO, CAMH said that, the opening of the two state-of-the art buildings for patient care is the culmination of years of dedication in the service of transforming care for people with mental illness. “I want to extend my most sincere appreciation to Stantec, and all of our redevelopment project partners, who worked with CAMH to design and build these world-class facilities.
