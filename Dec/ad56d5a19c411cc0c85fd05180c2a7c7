The construction works on the proposed hydrocracking complex for Assiut refinery in Egypt is set to begin following the successful completion of the remaining conditions required for the implementation of the project. This was announced by TechnipFMC plc, a global oil and gas company that provides complete project life cycle services for the energy industry, and which won the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract for the project advertised by Assiut National Oil Processing Company (ANOPC), a subsidiary of Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC)’s Assiut Oil Refining Co. (ASORC). The more than US $1bn contract covers the construction of new processing units such as a Vacuum Distillation Unit, a Diesel Hydrocracking Unit, a Delayed Coker Unit, a Distillate Hydrotreating Unit as well as a Hydrogen Production Facility Unit which will utilize TechnipFMC’s steam reforming proprietary technology.

This will reinforce the economic growth of rural areas, contribute to the fulfillment of the needs of the Upper Egypt region in terms of petroleum products, and at the same time reduce the volume of petroleum imports to the country and minimize harzadous environmental emissions.
