The Subansiri hydropower project has been stalled for nearly eight years due to intense protests by many groups in Assam. Construction work at the ambitious project at Gerukamukh along the Assam-Arunachal Pradesh border on Subansiri river was abruptly stopped from December 2011 to October 2019 due to protests by locals and many groups fearing about safety and the adverse impact on the downstream of the river.

Activists in the region rocked the environment by shouting various slogans opposing the dam project and the governments at the Centre and in the State for supporting the contentious project taking U-turn of their past stand. They claim that the declaration has shown that the government has completely ignored the issue of securing the life and properties of the people living in the downstream area of River Subansiri and has hurt the sentiment of the anti-big dam activist organizations and the public who have been initiating extensive stirs for years opposing the controversial big river dam project.
