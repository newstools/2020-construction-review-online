During the test, the reinforced concrete structures are supposed to be filled with water and left for a minimum of six days to allow adequate water absorption time to take place in the concrete. The factors used to determine the water tightness of a reinforced concrete structure include; surrounding temperatures, linings of finishing layers used in the structure, and the structure’s location. After the test, an analysis will reveal how temperature, evaporation, and precipitation affect test results. Leave the water in the concrete structure for not less than five days to observe the leakage rate. According to America Concrete Institute (ACI), 0.1 percent of the leakage rate should be identified in the first 24 hours. If the open container’s water level does not match that of the concrete structure, evaporation and precipitation are taking place and should be used to examine the concrete structure recording.  Use the calibrated container to measure evaporation and precipitation throughout the test. The results of a water-tightness test can be exceedingly affected by evaporation and precipitation. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_8',115,'0','0']));It is crucial to retest the reinforced concrete structure for water-tightness if the first test fails to avoid leakage in the future. It will take more time and cost to repair any damage caused by a leak than the inceptive price and testing time.
