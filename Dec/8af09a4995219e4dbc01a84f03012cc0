According to Mr Olukayode Popoola, the Federal Controller of Works Lagos, the works are progressing steadily. “Work on the surface of the bridge is over 70% complete, but the entire project is 22% complete with the inclusion of construction underneath,” he said. “On the Island-bound lane where we are working now, the contractor is ready to cast another three expansion joints this weekend, but because of the festive period, we have a lot of vehicles on the road. We were advised to leave it till next week maybe during the public holiday where we will do the total closure, then, we will be able to cast the three expansion joints,” affirmed Mr. Popoola. He further added that efforts were on to ensure the contractor completed the ongoing replacement of expansion joints on the top of the bridge before the February 22nd, 2021 delivery date. “Work could continue under the bridge even after it is reopened to traffic,” he said.

If we are talking of only the surface, it has achieved more than 70% completion. The contractor is working under the bridge on the abutment, the Pile Caps and Piers. The Abutment is where the bridge either starts or ends, where the bridge abuts all the load,” he said.
