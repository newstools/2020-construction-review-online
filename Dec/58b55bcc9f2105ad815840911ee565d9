All around the world, there is an increase in the uptake of solar energy. It has become the fastest-growing renewable energy in the world. Several countries around the world are in a race to establish their place in the solar energy sector. The global solar energy industry is mainly dominated by China and the USA who account for two-thirds of the global output. The global solar energy output has increased by around 60% in the last five years. By 2018, the global solar energy output amounted to 485.82GW. Below are the largest solar plants in the world based on capacity. The Topaz solar farm is a 550MW plant located in the north-western part of the Carrisa Plains in San Luis Obispo County, California, US. The solar farm was developed by First Solar but later sold to BHE Renewables in 2012, who commissioned it in 2014. The entire solar project sits on 4,700 acres of land and has more than eight million solar modules. The power produced from this plant is used by around 180,000 households in California. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));Also developed by First Solar, Desert Sunlight solar farm is situated in the Mojave Desert in Riverside County, California, US.  The solar plant is co-owned by GE Energy Financial Services, NextEra Energy Resources, and Sumitomo Corporation of America. Solar Star Projects is made up of two projects- Solar Star 1 and Solar Star 2 located in the Kern and Los Angeles counties, Rosamond, California, US. Jointly, the two projects have more than 1.7 million solar modules on 3,200 acres of land making it one of the largest solar plants in the world. They both have a combined output of 579MW. Solar Star Projects were developed by SunPower Corporation and owned by BHE Renewables. The project was completed in 2015 and supplies power to over 250,000 homes. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));The Kamuthi solar plant is located in Tamil Nadu, India, and has a production capacity of 648MW. The farm has around 2.5 million solar panels sitting on 2,500 acres of land. The power plant generates power supplied to around 750,000 homes. The Kamuthi solar facility was constructed at a cost of around $680m and completed in  A total of 8,500 people worked on the installation of the solar panels and the project was completed in a record eight months. The Enel Villanueva PV Plant is located in the Mexican state of Coahuila and is made up of over 2.5 million solar panels. The solar facility sits on 2,400ha of land and has a total capacity of 828MW. The plant was developed by the Enel Group, which invested $710 million in the project. The facility was initially planned to generate 54MW but was later raised to 828MW after a 10% increase in capacity was added in the contract. With a capacity of 850MW, the Longyangxia solar park is able to power 200,000 households. The solar park is located on the Tibetan Plateau in northwestern China’s Qinghai province and occupies 27km². The Longyangxia solar park has around four million solar panels and is operated by State Power Investment Corporation, one of the top power generators in China. The project was done in two phases at a total cost of $920.84 million, with Phase 1 completed in 2013 while Phase 2 was completed in 2015. Kurnool solar park is located in the Kurnool district and sits on 5,683.22 acres of land. The project has a capacity of 1,000MW and was built at a cost of around $1 billion. Kurnool solar park was co-developed by SBG Cleantech Project (350MW), Greenko Group (500MW), Azure Power (100MW), and Prayatna Developers (50MW). It has more than four million solar panels.
