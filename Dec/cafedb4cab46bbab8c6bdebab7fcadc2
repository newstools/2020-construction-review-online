The extension and development works of the Southern Meliane wastewater treatment plant in Radés, a harbor city in Ben Arous Governorate, Tunisia have been put in motion following a site visit by Mustapha Laroui, the North African country’s Minister of Local Affairs and Environment. Laroui was in the company of representatives of partner financial institutions including the French Ambassador to Tunisia, André Parant, and the European Union Ambassador, Marcus Cornaro. The project includes the construction of an anaerobic digestion system for the settling sludge, as well as valorization into biogas. The National Sanitation Office (ONAS) of Tunisia which is the projects implementing body is also planning to reinforce the deodorization system of the plant, as well as the construction of a sea outfall for the discharge of treated wastewater. The project aims to increase the capacity of the Méliane wastewater treatment plant to 90,000 m3 per day from the current 37,500 m3 per day.
