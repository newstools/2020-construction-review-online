The project was launched by the North African country’s Minister of Culture, Youth, and Sports, Othman El Ferdaous. It will cost a total of US$ 9.0m, which will be equally allocated by the Wilaya (Governorate) of Beni Mellal-Khenifra and the Moroccan Royal Football Federation (FRMF), the governing body of football in Morocco. According to Minister El Ferdaous the implementation of the project will take approximately 24 months to complete. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));The sporting complex will span a surface area of 70,000 square meters, including 8,300 square meters of indoor facilities.

The outdoor facilities on the other hand will include two large football pitches, one covered by natural grass and the other with artificial turf, as well as a training ground. Before launching the construction work of the football training center, the minister chaired the inauguration ceremony of the Beni Mellal stadium, which was closed for several months for renovation. The renovation works mainly focused on equipping the stands with seats and the field with artificial turf as well as the changing rooms and public restrooms. The ministry expects the football training center and the Beni Mellal stadium to benefit local youth, both boys and girls, and encourage them to practice sports in parallel with their studies. Graduates of the training center will be able to join local football clubs, such as Raja Beni Mellal (RBM), which is currently competing in the second division of the Moroccan league, Botola 2.
