When you have a flat tire, an air compressor might be the first thing that comes to your mind. But what about when you are carpentering or in need of a pressure washer? Although you might not think about an air compressor in these times, you will be blown away by the versatile use of a good air compressor. An air compressor is a multifaceted tool; just the tool you want handy when fixing a flat tire, spray painting, sandblasting, or cleaning up. An air compressor can power different pneumatic tools and operate them, working behind the scene rather than doing the work itself. It might not have any definitive use, but you can make the most out of it when you couple it with other tools. An air compressor will make the task easier and less time consuming for you. Let’s get a deeper dive into the multifaceted use of an air compressor and understand why you need to buy one. How Does an Air Compressor Work? eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));Before we move on to its use, we need to know how an air compressor works.  An air compressor work principle can be simplified to that of a balloon. When you pop an inflated balloon, the huge pressure built inside the balloon struggles to come out of the small hole, creating a surge of the air force. An air compressor also takes in the air into a container and pressurizes it. The high pressured air is then forced out through an opening. This air outlet is what we use because it creates a sudden, forceful impact, making it easier to operate an air tool or nail gun. However, this working principle can vary depending on the type of air compressors. Why an Air Compressor Is a Must-Have Tool Air compressors can have varied uses depending on their mechanism type- if you are working in construction, you might need a rotary screw compressor; for small home renovation, you might need a reciprocating compressor. Finding the nicest one for you that can take up a variety of works can be challenging. However, if you know your primary purpose for buying an air compressor, it might become more straightforward. Here we have explained why you need an air compressor for your workshop or home. To Help You with Auto Repair You can’t think about undertaking an auto repair project without having an air compressor. This might be the only tool you need for routine car maintenance. Whether you want to remove a spark plug, change the fuel filters, or remove bolts from narrow spaces, an air compressor is your tool. You can attach the hose with different apparatus to fit with your desired task at hand. To Use It for Cleaning An air compressor might be the king of dry cleaning. Whether you need to quickly dust off your worktop or clean some machinery parts with little crevices, you need an air compressor. Even a tedious job like cleaning your vacuum cleaner’s filter will take a minute with an air compressor. You can use an air compressor just how you would use a pressure washer; the difference is cleaning is done by air, not water. To Help You with Woodworking If you are familiar with woodworking, you know how expensive it is to have a battery-powered nail gun. An air compressor provides you a much affordable and effective solution, just hook up a nail gun with your air compressor and see how fast you can accomplish so much. You can run staple guns, pneumatic clamps, or blow off sawdust with relative ease and less power. To Help You with Spray Painting If you are a messy painter, you can make the task easier by merely operating your spray gun with an air compressor. Spray painting can ensure an even layer of paint and overall good workmanship. From DIY home renovation to repainting your furniture, spray painting is fun with an air compressor. Although it might take some practice, once you get the hang of it, you might not think about picking up a brush and paint bucket ever again! To Inflate Your Car Tiers Inflating a car tier is the most apparent use of an air compressor. Couple it with a regulator and a tire chuck, and you have got yourself a mini garage set up. However, be careful filling up your tier; make sure you don’t go over the maximum recommended pressure. To Help You with Construction You can run different construction tools using an air compressor, such as an impact wrench, nail gun, or a drill. It comes conveniently if you are working on a project site that has no provision of supplying electricity. It also ensures faster construction work and does the job nicely. As air tools are lighter than electric tools and have more power, you can work with more flexibility. To Help You with Sandblasting Whenever you remove paint from a wooden or metal surface, you can use an air compressor to make the job much easier and faster. An air compressor can also be used for removing rust from metal. If you want to smooth out a surface, try using an air sander instead of an electric sander; you will be relieved from all the heat produced by the electric one. On a final note, an air compressor’s adaptable quality makes it a must-have tool for your workshop or home.  It is both affordable and easy to use, as simple as using a hose. If you are worried about the air compressor’s large size and how much space it will take up from your workshop, put your worry to rest. Modern air compressors are very compact in design, and they won’t take up huge space. You don’t even have to think about the air compressor being bulky or heavy. New designed portable air compressors are light enough to carry around. However, to avoid any accident, make sure you stick to the level of pressure recommended by the tools you are using. Cranking up the pressure high above the maximum limit can damage your air compressor.
