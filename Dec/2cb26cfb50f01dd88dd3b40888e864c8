Approved by the Board of Directors of the African Development Bank (AfDB) as a technical assistance project, the grant will cater to three main components. These components are; the realization of technical studies for the integration of variable renewable energies (mainly solar) in national grids; the feasibility studies for the hybridization of solar energy production systems from existing isolated grids; and capacity building to help Chad integrate the first solar energy production project which is Djermaya PV IPP plant, into its national grid.

These operations should make it possible to eliminate various obstacles hampering the development of the energy sector in the Sahel countries, in particular the lack of sufficient installed production capacity, high dependence on imported fossil fuels, and an inability of networks.
