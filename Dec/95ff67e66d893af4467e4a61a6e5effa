The project was carried out in three phases. The first phase concerned the widening and rehabilitation of the road through the installation of bituminous concrete bearing layer and surface coating. The second phase and the third phase concerned the construction of a bridge on river RUSIZI, and the Development of border parking lots and sanitation in Gatumba crossing respectively. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));The project was funded by the European Union through the 11th European Development Fund (EDF). The newly inaugurated road is set to accommodate an increased volume of traffic plying the route and at the same time decrease transport costs and time it takes to and from the East and Central African countries. The RN4 is the preferred supply axis for the Congolese cities of Uvira, Fizi, Kalemie, and even Bukavu. In addition, the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO) frequently uses Bujumbura airport as a logistics base and more than often uses this road corridor.
