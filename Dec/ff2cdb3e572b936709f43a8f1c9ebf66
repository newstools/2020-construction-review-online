The US $39m project will see the widening of the State Route 74 from Lake Elsinore to the Riverside County/Orange County line. This is in order to enhance the safety of this busy route between the cities of Lake Elsinore and San Juan Capistrano. The scope of work includes the construction of widened shoulders and rumble strips in each direction, as well as increased super-elevations on the curves for added safety. According to Granite Regional Vice President Brad Williams, this section of State Route 74 Ortega Highway, which connects Interstate 15 and Interstate 5, is narrow and winding, so the addition of shoulders and rumble strips will improve safety for the traveling public. “This project is an internal joint venture between our Desert Cities and South Coast regions, so each team brings their unique expertise to this partnership with Caltrans,” he added. Construction is expected to begin in February 2021 and conclusion is scheduled for June 2022.
