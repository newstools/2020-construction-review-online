The agreement was signed in Dakar, the capital city of the West African country, by Alioune Ndoye, the Minister of Fisheries and Maritime Economy in Senegal, and Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, group chairman and CEO of DP World, after constructive, detailed, and fruitful discussions between HE Macky Sall, President of Senegal, and the DP World CEO. As per the agreement, DP World Dakar SA, the local joint venture between DP World and Port of Dakar (PAD), will inject US$ 837m for the execution of the first phase of the project. This stage includes the development of a 300 ha container terminal, a 5 km sea channel, and the construction of an 840 m quay – 18 m deep – sized to accommodate post-Panamax and 366 m longships. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));The second phase of the project, which will mobilize US$ 290m, will see the construction of a second wharf of 410 m and the additional dredging of the sea channel.

Located on the Petite-Côte south of Dakar, this port upon completion will significantly decongest the Autonomous Port of Dakar (PAD) that currently captures 95% of the country’s trade, but also 80% of hydrocarbons and 65% of other traffic from Mali. It will also create jobs, attract new foreign direct investment to the country, and enable new trading opportunities that bring about economic diversification.
