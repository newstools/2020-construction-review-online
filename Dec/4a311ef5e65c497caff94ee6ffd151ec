The grant will particularly finance critical urban infrastructure investments in the city and support the implementation of municipal reforms. Idah Z. Pswarayi-Riddihough, the World Bank’s country director for Mozambique, Madagascar, Comoros, Mauritius, and Seychelles said that this investment will ultimately contribute to harnessing the role of Maputo as the East African country’s economic powerhouse by investing in urban infrastructure and services while supporting critical reforms to ensure that urbanization in the capital city can contribute to economic growth, poverty reduction, and structural transformation.

These components include land demarcation, construction of priority urban infrastructures, and implementation of sites-and-services for low-income families. They will create incentives for better solid waste management services, restore livelihoods for informal waste pickers, and increase reuse or recycling practices. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));Improvement to access to safe water and sanitation will also be looked into under the aforementioned components.
