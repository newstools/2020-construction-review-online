Mr. Macharia said that apart from the construction of the new railway line which is expected to begin starting March next year and take approximately two years to complete, the aid will also be used to redo the old 17-kilometer railway track from the Nairobi Railway Central Station to Syokimau train terminus. The loan facility is a result of an agreement signed by the President of the East African country, H.E Uhuru Kenyatta, and his French counterpart President Emmanuel Macron during the latter’s first-ever visit to Kenya in March last year.

The distance between JKIA and Nairobi City Centre is 20km, and normally it should take between 30 minutes and an hour at most to travel between the two points, however, it takes up to 120 minutes due to traffic on the usually busy Mombasa Road. The commuter train service will freely ship at least 500,000 urban commuters daily for a period of 12 months upon its completion. The number is expected to rise up to 1 000 000 in the following five years’ time.
