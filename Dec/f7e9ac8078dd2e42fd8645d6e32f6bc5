Hualong One is a third-generation pressurized water reactor developed and designed by China National Nuclear Corporation based on more than 30 years of nuclear power research, design, manufacturing, construction, and operation experience, the company said. It has a design life of 60 years and a 177 assembly core design with an 18-month refueling cycle. CNNC said all technical indicators of the unit were in compliance with the design requirements, and the unit was in good condition, laying a solid foundation for the subsequent commercial operation. “This signals that China has broken the monopoly of foreign nuclear power technology and has officially entered the ranks of advanced countries in nuclear power technology,” CNNC noted.
