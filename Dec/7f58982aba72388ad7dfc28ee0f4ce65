The 1.6km road stretches from Abraham Nyambali to Kahumba Kandola Street. According to Ongwediva town council’s spokesperson Jackson Muma, the council through its road network plan has the mandate to upgrade roads that link residents to institutions and essential service providers. He further requested the residents to provide their full support and cooperation to the contractor to ensure timely completion of the project; even as they prepare for traffic interruptions during the construction period, in extension 6, 7 and 8. The US $412,844.03 road upgrade project is expected to be completed within eight months.

During the current financial year, the council has also rehabilitated gravel roads within the town, especially at extension 6 and 7. According to Muma, the council has also rehabilitated roads within its informal settlements. Furthermore, the council has also taken the stand to ensure the new extension gets bitumen roads from the onset. “The exercise will be less costly as opposed to putting up gravel roads and later upgrading them after a few years,” he said.
