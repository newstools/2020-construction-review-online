The consortium will work alongside Elsewedy Electric T&D (EETD), an Egyptian company that was awarded the solar project in December last year following a call for tenders launched by the South Sudanese Ministry of Electricity, Dams, Irrigation and Water Resources. For this project, Asunim Solar will provide engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) services as well as product sizing and verification, and on-site supervision services. Its partner, I-kWh, on the other hand, will contribute its expertise in electricity storage and management systems to the solar project.

This project is an indication that solar power is reliable and affordable in all parts of the world.” eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));I-kWh managing director, Aaron Astley on the other hand said” We are excited to be working with great organizations such as EETD and Asunim to support infrastructure development in South Sudan, particularly the Juba project which will set a new benchmark in terms of PV+ Storage projects in the region.” Built on a 25-hectare piece of land near Nesitu County, approximately 20km from Juba, the future photovoltaic solar power plant will consist of a 20MWp solar photovoltaic park, a 35MWh battery storage system to serve the state of Jubek and the entire region. It will be one of the largest storage projects implemented in the African continent and a first for the East African country, almost doubling the total grid-connected electricity generating capacity of the young nation that is currently 100% dependent on oil imports.
