The dam failed during a steady rain that drained Wixom Lake and unleashed the Tittabawassee River, which then overwhelmed the Sanford dam, about 225 kilometers north of Detroit. Construction will also be done inside the Tobacco River spillway crest in Gladwin and Midland counties to prepare it for being lowered by 6.4 meters, state officials stated. Lowering the spillway crest is expected to alleviate concerns about the stability of the remaining dam embankment, restore the natural flow to the Tobacco River, reverse negative impacts on natural resources and seek to avoid another major flooding event when the winter snow melts and spring rains arrive. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));The emergency construction work at the collapsed Michigan dam site is expected to be completed by February 2022 and US$2.3 million has been approved for the project by Michiganâ€™s Transportation Department and the Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy.
