Greefspan II solar power plant located in the Douglas town in the Northern Cape Province, South Africa, and whose construction began approximately two years ago, is now ready for commissioning following its successful completion. This was announced by GRS Energy, a Spanish company undertaking the project in partnership with the Spanish group TSK and the South African company Umbono Energy Partners. “We have reached the preliminary and final stage for the commissioning of the Greefspan II solar photovoltaic plant and we are now ready to begin grid connection tests shortly after successful registration” stated the Spanish company. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));The Greefspan II solar photovoltaic plant has 63.2 MWdc of installed capacity that will produce approximately 150,000 MWh of clean energy per year that the Alcobendas (Spain) based company estimates that can guarantee the clean energy supply for up to 20,000 South African households, whilst avoiding the annual emission of 130,000 tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.

The Greefspan II solar project is being developed by African Infrastructure Investment Managers (AIIM), which develops and manages private equity infrastructure funds designed to invest long-term institutional unlisted equity in African infrastructure projects, together with the IDEAS fund and Black Industrialist. The concession for this project was awarded by the South African government under the 4th round of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement (REIPPP) Programme.
