The project involves careful selection, design, and use of materials that leverage low carbon standards in the overall construction, and especially the application of near-zero embodied energy concrete designed by incorporating low carbon content cement.

Fundi masonry cement, a low carbon cement, will also be used for mortar and plaster works. Commenting on the new building innovation, Bamburi Cement Group Managing Director Seddiq Hassani, said that commitment to Green construction has long been a goal for the construction industry and that the launch of HoT is another step in Bamburi’s transition towards even more sustainable building solutions and towards a more sustainable construction industry overall. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_0',117,'0','0']));“In our ambition of becoming a net-zero company, we are not only part of the solution but, we are also committed to supporting our customers in their CO2-reduction ambitions. This project seeks to offer a more sustainable construction solution and we cannot wait for our customers to reap the benefits, from the product’s sustainability credentials and great performance,” stated the M.D The project will incorporate various other features in the ‘green construction’ theme, especially in the applications of materials – water harvesting systems, water reticulation systems, solar panels to cater for lighting and water heating needs, as well as features like large windows for maximum natural light and fresh air among others.
