Equipped with six 100 MW Francis turbines, the Karuma hydropower station is expected to have a capacity of about 600 MW upon completion. The electricity generated by the Kurama hydropower plant will guarantee stable, reliable, and affordable electricity in Uganda according to Stephen Kyeganwa Mukasa, UEGCL’s Head of Monitoring and Evaluation. With the commissioning of the Karuma power plant, the East African country will reach a capacity of 1500 MW. Currently, Ugandans consume approximately 600 MW at peak hours. The government has also revealed that once the plant is commissioned and fully utilized, the weighted generation tariff will reduce from the current US Cents 6.47/kWh to US Cents 5.34/kWh, indicating a 17.65% decrease.
