The unlawful contract by ABB, was for work at the Kusile Power station that commenced in 2015. The recovery follows the issuing of summons by Eskom and the SIU for damages of about US $257.8m in the North Gauteng High Court to recover funds from former Eskom executives, former Board members, members of the Gupta family and their associates. The settlement agreement is a culmination of years of work by various parties, particularly after detailed investigations by the Special Investigations Tribunal in terms of the Presidential Proclamation R11 of 2018, initiated by the Department of Public Enterprises (DPE). The SIU is currently executing proclamations into Denel, Transnet, Eskom and SAA. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));The DPE continues to monitor the implementation of consequence management arising from forensic reports at SOEs in order to ensure that those implicated in wrongdoings are brought to book.
