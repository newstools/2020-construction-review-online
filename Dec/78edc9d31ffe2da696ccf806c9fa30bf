Nearly 100 acres of the village will be dedicated to open space and a regional park. Due to its transit-, bicycle- and pedestrian-centric design, Circulate San Diego awarded the project a Mobility Certification and also testified on the project’s behalf. The Mobility Certification program evaluates and endorses transit-oriented, smart growth projects in the San Diego region that meet the program’s aspirational standards.

Bike and walking paths will skirt and traverse Riverwalk, including an extension of the San Diego River Trail. Riverwalk will feature 4,300 homes, 10% of which will be income-qualified affordable housing, ranging from studios to three-bedroom homes. It will also add 152,000-square-feet of neighborhood-serving retail and one million-square-feet of office space to the area. Additional transportation amenities will include intelligent traffic signals, new entryways on Friars Road and increased flood capacity improvements to Fashion Valley Road. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_0',117,'0','0']));The plan, established through a partnership between Hines and the Levi-Cushman family landowners, garnered recommendation from the City of San Diego Planning Commission and from the Mission Valley Community Planning Group. The Riverwalk plan incorporated extensive community input, gathered over several years by the Hines team in over 100 stakeholder and community planning group meetings and charettes. According to Hines Managing Director Eric Hepfer, Riverwalk is an opportunity to provide something really special for San Diego. “Our vision from the beginning was to create a village where people would have the option of living a car-free lifestyle,” he said.
