Some of these long stretched roads include: Sukuta- Willingkama, Brufut-Ghana Town; Touba Sanchaba road-Kerr Serign-Sukuta camping; and shorter ones like the Kanifing Hospital to GTMI and the Rev J.C. Faye roads amongst 20 other designated points. According to Mr Imded Gharbi, manager of Pan-Arab Consultants’ Engineers (PACE), the consultancy firm in collaboration with National Roads Authority (NRA), the design is taking some time because the construction works are taking place in an urban area and the specific character of each of the 20 sections must be taken into consideration as it determines what kind of road to be built. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));“The design for the roads is to be completed by end of 2020 and tenders for the project to be floated in 2021.The project is scheduled to start in March of 2021 and is expected to be completed in 12 months,” he said. He further added that the timeframe for the design is 30 years, but every road structure shall be subject to maintenance every 7 to 8 years to ensure durability.

She further added that the roads are being built for easy access to the summit and other places. “According to the NRA, within the KMC area, we have 300km of unpaved road so if we are going to have 56km out of it, I think it will be going for our development agenda,” she said.
