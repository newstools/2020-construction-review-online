Construction works on the new parliament building in Mt. Hampden, Zimbabwe have stalled due to COVID-19 global travel restrictions. According to President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the Chinese contractors working on the project were stuck in China due to the restrictions but have since been cleared to travel and are expected in Zimbabwe very soon. However due to this delay, construction will be completed in September next year, six months behind schedule. “There has been tremendous progress and achievements in terms of construction. I am sure the constraints came around as a result of Covid-19. I am sure that we would have far advanced where we are now. Arrangements have been made for technicians who have been out of the country to come and I believe that from next year, construction would be in pace,” said the president.
