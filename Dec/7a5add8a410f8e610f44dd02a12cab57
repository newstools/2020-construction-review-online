The power plant will be the largest upon completion. The power plan is located along the Victoria Nile at Karuma Falls. The Ugandan government first announced plans for the construction of a power station at Karuma Falls in 1995. Norpak, a Norwegian energy company was contracted to conduct the feasibility study and the environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the dam. The project was to be financed by the World Bank through a loan. In October 2006, the project’s feasibility study was released. In November of the same year, the government invited bids for the construction of the project. The initial plan was to build a 200-250 MW power station. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));The project plans were revised in 2009 to develop a much bigger dam of 750 MW. In the same year, Norpak withdrew from the project citing financial challenges due to the Global Recession of 2008-2012. Energy Infratech Private Limited was contracted to conduct a fresh feasibility study as well as EIA. In July 2011, the project’s capacity was scaled down to 600 MW. Some international development partners wanted to scale back even further, to a maximum capacity of 400 to 450 megawatts. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));Construction work at the power station officially started on 12 August 2013. In March 2015, Alstom was sub-contracted by Sinohydro, the lead contractor on the project to supply equipment and technical services to the power station. Alstom was paid $65 million in the deal. As of March 2016, around 30% of the project had been completed. The project employed around 5,000 Ugandans and 1,000 Chinese. As of February 2018, 74% of the project had been done. In June of the same year, 76% of the work had been completed. As of April 2019, around 80% of the project was complete. Three high voltage transmission lines were 80 to 85% complete at the time. In September 2019, the project was 95% complete including 100% completion of Karuma–Kawanda High Voltage Power Line, 100% of the Karuma–Lira High Voltage Line, and 98% of the Karuma–Olwiyo High Voltage Line. In November 2020, the Uganda government was said to be preparing to launch the project with much of the work completed. As of November 2020, the project was reported to be 98% complete. In December 2020, the government upgraded power lines in readiness for the launch of Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station.
