With a capacity of 45 kW, the project was designed, developed, and constructed by engineers of the Bui Power Authority (BPA) within a period of approximately 12 months. It was funded partly by BPA through internally-generated monies, and by the Danish Government as part of the China-Ghana South-South Cooperation on Renewable Energy Technology Transfer which aims to facilitate the exchange of expertise and technology on renewable energy between China and Ghana, with a focus on building the institutional framework and capacity required to facilitate the local absorption of the technologies. The 45kW Tsatsadu micro-hydro generating station is a run-of-river power plant, that is to say, a facility that does not depend on a dam for its operation. It consists of a concrete diversion weir otherwise known as retaining wall, an intake structure, diversion channel, a forebay, a steel penstock or else a pipe for conveying water to a hydroelectric station, a powerhouse, and a transmission line to deliver the electricity generated from the plant to the local distribution grid.

With the speed generated down the hill, the water turns a turbine that produces 45 kW of electricity. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));BPA estimates that the plant’s capacity can be expanded with a new 40- or 60-kW turbine.
