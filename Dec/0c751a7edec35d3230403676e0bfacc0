President Lazarus Chakwera has urged Zomba City Council (ZCC) and Ministry of Local Government to complete the construction as soon as possible. “I want that stadium completed so that one day I can watch a match there,” said Chakwera. DEC Construction Limited started the project back in 2017 but it has faced financial problems throughout which was compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic. This made the project miss its October 2020 deadline. Currently, the community hall and the VIP stand have been completed and the contractor is now working on open stands.

This meant that the contractor had to reduce the workforce and so the work is being done very slowly but surely it will come to an end,” said Chaluma. The president also noted that Zomba City, the former capital, used to be one of the best cities in Malawi and, because of its history, the council should find means of economically developing other than relying on funds from the Central Government. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));The government also plans to build a modern stadium in Mzuzu which will be located in the Mzuzu Youth Centre project.
