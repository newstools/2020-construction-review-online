They, however, also play a role in enabling a more integrated, automated and predictive view of facilities and infrastructure. Data in Construction Projects Generally the BIM (Building Information Model) life-cycle of a construction project is a very popular framework for collecting and organizing information relating to building project. <img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-117142" src="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/download-4-320x320.png" alt="" width="320" height="320" srcset="https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/download-4-320x320.png 320w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/download-4-420x420.png 420w, https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/download-4.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px" /> Application of sensors on drones in construction eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',117,'0','0']));A spate of technological advancements have accelerated the application of sensors in construction. Automatic data collection and analysis provide immense opportunities to improve, automate and optimize construction processes of major infrastructure of facilities which is a major advance from relying on static and standalone data sources.   New and innovative approaches that foster the application of sensors and remote sensing technologies on construction projects are, hence, eminently desirable for the growth and development of the construction industry. Some of these applications include:   Types of Data There are various types of data that can be collected. Methods There are various smethods that can used combining the various sources of data mentioned earlier. Emerging Technologies Various emerging technologies have become available to enhance the data collection process. Technology changes at a rapid pace and with the evolution of sensors on UAV platforms that can get closer to hard to access infrastructure, site managers have been able to digitize several aspects of their operations with a variety of recently emerging technologies. Integrated Solutions The real benefit comes with being able to integrate the various solution processes. Major techniques include: Monitoring Outputs Using Drones Construction by its nature can be difficult to access and dangerous. Remote site surveys from an aerial perspective provides invaluable information in any construction project. The following output deliverables are common: Aerial Site Assessments Aerial drones are perfect for surveying large areas of developed land, construction sites and other high risk infrastructure. Infrastructure Condition Assessment The low-flying capabilities of drones ensure the capture of precise and detailed data, thereby providing up-to-date and accurate information to support business endeavours such as site development and building refurbishment. Construction Progress Monitoring Having photos of various stages of a construction project can show the progress of the project as well as assist in planning activities. The generated maps highlight the location of structures, foundations, and services such as piping, plumbing and electrical systems. Survey and Mapping Using photogrammetry (a surveying and mapping technique), drones provide quick deployment and turn-around times with accurate reporting from point cloud datasets. Reports include survey ground control, processing, and reporting tasks. Topographic Surveys Uneven terrain can cause difficult and hazard working conditions for surveyors travelling over land on foot. Drones are able to quickly and precisely retrieve topographical maps of large areas with minimal wear and tear on equipment and low risk. As-Built Surveys Accurate and detailed as-built drawings are essential to ensure the most current version of construction projects. Drones can survey areas of interest to offer superior, speedy, and accurate data and models in the cost-effective manner. UAV Platforms   Different UAV (Drone) platforms are available to be deployed depending on the requirements. 2. Fixed wings can meet larger area monitoring requirements but provide lesser resolution and detail. A further refinement of UAV options is a VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) Fixed Wing that combines the strengths of both fixed wing and multirotor UAVs. Drones are playing a key role in bring 4IR technologies to Construction projects. Airborne Drones Is a specialist manufacturer of long range drones.
