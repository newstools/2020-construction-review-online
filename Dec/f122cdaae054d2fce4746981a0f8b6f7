The 4.8 kilometers double-line dual-gauge Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Railway Bridge virtually was inaugurated when the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina virtually laid the foundation stone from her residence in Dhaka. The US$ 2 billion megaproject has been funded partly by the Japan International Cooperation Agency who will provide US$1.4 billion while the rest will be financed by the national Bangladeshi government and is scheduled to be completed by 2025 and will be built 300m upstream of the Bangabandhu Bridge. It is expected to be the largest dedicated rail bridge in the country. The bridge would improve regional rail connectivity as it would allow Bangladesh Railway to operate more trains between the capital and the country’s northwestern regions.
