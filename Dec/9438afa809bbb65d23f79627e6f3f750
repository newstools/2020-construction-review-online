The Highway 101 Segment 4C Santa Barbara to Carpinteria project is the final phase of a larger program to increase safety, mobility, and provide congestion relief along US Route 101 in Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties. Segment 4C adds 1.7 miles of high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes in Santa Barbara County to reduce traffic congestion between Santa Barbara and Ventura.

The project improves motorist sight distance and enhances aesthetics throughout the corridor. Granite’s material facilities in Santa Barbara County will supply aggregates and asphalt concrete for the project. CM/GC procurement involves the contractor during the design and planning phases, offers a lower risk profile for both the contractor and the owner, thus increasing the overall value to taxpayers. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));According to Caltrans Acting SB 101 Corridor Manager David Emerson, the CM/GC process facilitates increased innovation and collaboration between Caltrans and Granite which reduces construction duration, costs, and risk. “We are pleased to sustain our relationship with Granite on this multiyear project to improve our roads through SB1,” he said. Construction is underway and is expected to conclude in August 2023.
