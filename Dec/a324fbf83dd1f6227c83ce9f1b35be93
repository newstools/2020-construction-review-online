Through the Office of the Vice Chancellor’s Environmental Sustainability Directorate, the university has prepared a detailed technical and financial feasibility study for the potential of rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) installations across all campuses. Among the building’s biggest sustainable features is an energy-saving 63.5 kWpeak (or kWp) grid-tied PV system (solar energy) that will be installed on the roof by Solareff, who was awarded the tender for the contract. The PV’s monitoring system will be cloud-based, enabling monitoring to be done online. The data will be accessible via the internet and smartphone applications or set up on a smart TV in the d-school. The energy fed into the building’s grid will be used to supplement the electricity from the municipality, and although the building won’t be self-sufficient, its reliance on the municipal grid will be reduced significantly. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1']));According to Solareff project manager, Leigh-An Becker, as the d-school’s roof will feature a large section of fritted low-emissivity (low-e) glass for the atrium, reducing the available roof surface area, a high-power-class monocrystalline module is being proposed to achieve maximum energy yields.

The underground parking area also has bays for electric cars. The d-school is aiming at a six-star Green Star rating from the Green Building Council South Africa, a status conferred on world leaders in environmental sustainability. If successful, it will be the first six-star Green Star-rated academic building in Africa.
