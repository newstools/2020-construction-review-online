A housing project of 112 new homes is set developed at 300 Harrow Road by Willmott Dixon for Westminster City Council in the UK. The development will consist of one, two and three bedroom homes to suit a variety of households with 50% affordable, either social or intermediate rent, allowing a wide range of people the chance to live in the heart of London. The affordable homes will be let to people who live and work locally, helping to address the need for more social and intermediate housing in the area. Alongside the new homes, the project will deliver over 1,400 square metres of community facilities including a new community hall, nursery, flexible workspace and canal-side café. The development will also improve the surrounding green space, activating the area and giving residents easy access to Regents Canal.

By delivering this new development, we are connecting our residents with the vibrancy and opportunity Westminster has to offer,” he asserted. Willmott Dixon will work with the architect Child Graddon Lewis, with both companies behind Westminster’s award-nominated Dudley House, a development of 197 affordable homes which launched in Paddington Basin last year.
