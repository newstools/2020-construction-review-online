The statement also noted that there shall be markings of the new carpet to delineate areas for parking and for taxi and pedestrian movements. The boundaries of the park will be retained properly to prevent mud from washing onto the carpet as it has previously been the case. Furthermore the project shall see the facility get structures such as alighting and waiting sheds for passengers, sanitary facilities such as toilets, an administration block and a Police Post in addition to new designated entry and exit points for both vehicles and pedestrians. This will include access control for vehicles to avoid queuing on the surrounding roads and congestion within the park area.
