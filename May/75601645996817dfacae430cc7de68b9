Sand is actually one of the most commonly used construction materials around the world. Its versatility can be seen implemented as a component within concrete and cement, in addition to filling for different spaces such as holes in walls and crawl space areas of a home or layers below surface floors. When cement, sand and water are mixed together they form mortar, which is created to increase both the resistance and flexibility of the material. This all depends on the amount of sand that is added to the corresponding mix. This makes sand a necessary element within the construction process as it provides a number of benefits for concrete. Included in those benefits is that when the mix is blended well it avoids cracks when dried and hardened. It also helps to join construction elements more effectively as its better drying process helps bricks to fuse together better and become sturdier.

Three counties which border Nairobi and are the sources of sand used in construction in the city have placed a ban on sand harvesting to protect the environment. The counties, which include Makueni and Machakos, said sand harvesters have been mining the commodity without regard to the environment. Other counties that have banned sand harvesting or placed stricter control on the activity include Kitui and Kajiado. The bans placed nearly a month ago have raised the cost of sand by at least 30% pushing developers on the brink. 20 tons of sand is currently being sold at Ksh 40,000 up from Ksh 30,000 weeks ago.
