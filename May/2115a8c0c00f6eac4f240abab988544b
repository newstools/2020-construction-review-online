The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved a US $177m loan to upgrade 450km of state highways and and other road projects in Maharashtra, India. Under the Maharashtra state road improvement project, two major district roads and 11 state highways, with combined length of 450km will be upgraded to two-lane standard across seven districts. The projects would improve connectivity to national highways, interstate roads, seaports, airports, rail hubs, district headquarters, industrial areas, enterprise clusters and agricultural areas. According to Sameer Kumar Khare, Additional Secretary Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of Finance, the project will improve connectivity between rural areas and urban centres in the state enabling rural communities to better access markets, employment opportunities and services. “Improved mobility will expand development and livelihood opportunities outside of the state’s major urban centres to second-tier cities and towns thus reducing income disparities,” he added.
