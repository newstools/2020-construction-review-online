The construction of the first phase of Africa Logistics Properties (ALP) warehousing complex at Tilisi logistical park, located in the Tilisi mega-city which is set on the Waiyaki Way intersection with Nairobi’s southern bypass in Kenya, is set to be complete by next December, regardless of the construction sector slowdown caused by the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Mr. Richard Hough, ALP chief executive said that the company has put measures in place to ensure that the project does not stop and all 172 jobs at the site are retained. “We remain committed to doing our part during this hard time by ensuring that no jobs are lost. In regards to curbing the spread of the virus, we have implemented mandatory temperature checks and sanitisation at all of our ALP West site entry points as well as ensuring that all employees on-site constantly wear face masks at all times,” said the ALP chief executive.

They are particularly built for small and medium enterprises planning to scale up business via a warehouse space subscription service facility. Mr. Hough says that the decision to start with the 500 square meters warehouses was to allow small-scale distributors to reduce their cost of storage and improve their supply chain and operations efficiency. He added that they also intend to cater for businesses with specific needs or requirements at the ALP West site. Mr. Hough mentioned that within the last month, they have received several local and international companies in the information technology, food and beverage, logistics and fast-moving consumer goods businesses, seeking more information about the development. The prospective tenants have maintained firm commitments to take up 55 percent of the lease-able space as soon as the Corona virus cloud clears.
