Construction work of the Kiambu-Ruaka water supply and sewerage project in Kenya has kicked off according to Sicily Kariuki, the country’s Water, Sanitation and Irrigation Cabinet Secretary. The project was awarded to China Henan International Cooperation Group Co., Ltd by the Athi Water Works Development Agency (AWWDA) and the construction work involves the rehabilitation of the existing Kiambu wastewater treatment plant, the construction of 108 kilometers of the trunk and reticulation sewers covering areas of Kiambu and Ruaka, the construction of 25 kilometers water distribution network, the construction of four ablution blocks, the drilling of six boreholes with 48m3 pressed steel tanks and 450 last-mile household connections. Expected to be complete by July 2021, the over US$ 12M project is being funded by the African Development Bank and it is a part of the Kenya Towns Sustainable Water Supply and Sanitation Program. This is a program by the national government with which it aims to provide fast-growing towns such as Ruaka, Kiambu, Kikuyu, Limuru, Machakos, Kisumu, Narok, Kakamega, Eldoret, Marsabit, Changamwe, Kitui, Watamu, and Nanyuki among others, with sustainable water and sewerage systems to cater for their growing populations.

Additionally, the program will create more than 15,000 new jobs during and after its implementation. The areas around Kiambu and Ruaka have never had sewer connections before according to Cabinet Secretary Kariuki, regardless of their growing population, especially Ruaka which has been expanding in terms of population as more people move from the rural areas to settle in the town. Upon completion, the Kiambu-Ruaka water supply and sewerage project is expected to benefit over 100,000 residents living in and around these areas.
