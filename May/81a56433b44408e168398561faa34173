The Morton Jaffray water treatment plant in Harare, Zimbabwe was temporarily shut down on 30th April to undergo much needed upgrades. The upgrade works included the fitting of a new pump, valve and repair of major leaks which were hindering the proper distribution of water in the city. According to Corporate and communications manager Michael Chideme, the temporary shutdown from 4pm to 6pm is to allow for the installation of a pump at Warren Control Pump Station to match the improved water delivery capacity that is now averaging 300 million liters a day. “Other outstanding work that includes the repair of leaks at Warren Control Pump Station and installation of the main delivery valve on pump number 8 at Morton Jaffray will also be done,” he confirmed.
