The Texas Transportation Commission has approved US $3.4bn plan for I-35 improvements through Austin in the US . The Commission approved an update to the 2020 Unified Transportation Program (UTP) to allocate the funds for the I-35 Capital Express Central project which includes the I-35 improvements. The money is from the Commission’s discretionary funds not previously allocated in the UTP, a 10-year planning document that guides the development of the state’s future transportation projects. Earlier in April, the Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization passed a resolution committing US $633m to the Capital Express project. In addition, around US $300m will be considered by the Commission when it votes on the 2021 UTP in Aug. 2020. The funding, identified by Chairman J. Bruce Bugg, Jr., is the result of years of planning and discussions with Governor Greg Abbott, regional transportation planners and stakeholders.

Additional auxiliary and frontage road lanes roads would also be built. The Commission also approved a conditional award for a design-build contract to construct the Oak Hill Parkway project. Colorado River Constructors was selected as the design-build contractor and will complete the final design for the more than US $600m project and construct the state-of-the-art highway at the intersection of US 290 and SH 71 in Oak Hill. The project includes three mainlanes in each direction along US 290, as well as two to three frontage road lanes in each direction. Flyovers will be built at the US 290 and SH 71 intersection, where the mainlanes of US 290 would be depressed, or go under SH 71. Construction is expected to begin in late 2020.
