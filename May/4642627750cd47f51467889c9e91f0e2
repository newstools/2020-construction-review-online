Construction of the 700MW Noor Energy 1 concentrated solar power (CSP) project in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) is progressing well despite limitations imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. A group of multinational contractors engaged in the US $4.4bn project has put in place measures to keep the on-site workers safe and home-based staff well-connected. China’s Shanghai Electric, the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contractor for Noor Energy 1, has supplied personal protection equipment (PPE) to all workers and implemented procedures for virus prevention and control. Worley said that Shanghai Electric had to source workers locally when many of its staff were prevented from returning to the site following the Chinese New Year celebrations. The safety measures have ensured that labour, schedule and budget disruptions are kept to a minimum.
