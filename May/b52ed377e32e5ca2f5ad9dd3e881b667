Lekki Deep Sea Port Project currently under construction at the Lagos Free Trade Zone in Ibeju-Lekki, Nigeria, has received an infusion of over US$221M equity funding from China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC). This was made known by Mr. Biodun Dabiri, the Chairman of Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited the company in charge of the development. Dabiri said that the equity injection coming at this time despite the global economic meltdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, shows the deep commitment of CHEC to the success of the project which will significantly contribute to fast-tracking the timely delivery of the project and bring about economic prosperity to the West African region. Lekki Deep Sea Port Project was awarded to Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited by Nigerian Ports Authority on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) agreement. Under this agreement, LPLEL is required to develop, finance, build, operate the port for a period of 45 years and transfer it to NPA thereafter.
