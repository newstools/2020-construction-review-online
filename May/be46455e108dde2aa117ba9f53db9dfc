Genesal Energy, a Spanish company in the business of manufacturing and supplying energy to both industry and private clients since 1994, has recently delivered nine completely customized and special gensets to Africa, a continent full of contrasts and a real challenge from an energetic point of view. In line with its aim to offer efficient solutions for any type of energy challenge, whilst adapting the product to the proposed situation, Genesal Energy supplied the products precisely to Gambia, Guinea Bissau & Guinea Conakry, to be used for emergency power supply for electric substations. With a power range of 9xGEN110FI, the gensets are designed to run in perfect conditions in isolated areas and they can withstand the extreme heat in the West African countries as they have the ability to operate in extreme temperatures of up to 45Â°C.
