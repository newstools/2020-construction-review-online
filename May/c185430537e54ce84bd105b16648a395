Furthermore, they are equipped with connected sensors that enable Fonroche teams to monitor the operation of the streetlights remotely and if one of them fails to provide sufficient lighting, it can be adjusted from a control center. “In a solar streetlight, 80% of the added value comes from the battery and the software, which allow the power to be delivered intelligently to ensure operation for 10 years, or 4,000 cycles,” says Laurent Lubrano, the managing director of Fonroche Eclairage. The project is not only meant to illuminate the Senegalese streets but also help in the improvement of the day to day lives of the local population.
