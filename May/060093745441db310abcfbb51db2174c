Planning consent for the next residential phase at Watford Riverwell in UK has been achieved; Kier Property, the property division of Kier Group has announced. The planning meeting took place on the 1st of April 2020 and due to the Coronavirus pandemic was undertaken as Watford Borough Council’s first virtual planning committee. The scheme will deliver 192 new high-quality homes consisting of 142 much-needed family houses, of mixed types including two, three and four-bed houses as well as three-bed maisonettes. The scheme also includes 50, one and two-bed apartments set above a new community centre to serve Riverwell and the surrounding area. The apartments and maisonettes are situated to disguise the proposed new 1,450-space multi-story car park to serve Watford General Hospital, which received consent last year. Most importantly to the borough of Watford the scheme will deliver 35% affordable housing, with social and affordable tenures located in the terraced housing.
