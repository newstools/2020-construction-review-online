Construction of Asia’s largest underground station “The Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC)” in Mumbai, India is set for completion in 2020. BKC is an underground station on the Mumbai Metro, a rapid transit system that is currently under construction. The rapid transit system in the Indian metropolis will serve the city of Mumbai itself as well as its entire metropolitan area in the federal state of Maharashtra. The underground station is located on the section of the 33.5-km-long Colaba-Bandra-SEEPZ line (also known as line 3) that connects the Cuffe Parade business district in the extreme south of the city to the Santacruz Electronics Export Processing Zone (SEEPZ) and the Aarey in the north. Upon completion, the BKC will act as an extremely important hub for passengers looking to change swiftly to line 2. Special feature: the BKC will be the largest underground station on the Asian continent.

The first level is 8.4 m high, ending with a 750-mm-thick slab. The second level is 5.5 m high and ends with a 1,200-mm-thick floor. Since all loads acting on the slabs are transferred directly into the columns, approximately 1450-mm-thick drop panels were used between the columns and the slabs. PERI has been providing assistance by supplying comprehensive formwork and scaffolding solutions, since construction began on the major project in April 2019 so that the BKC can be completed within the demanding construction time-scale of only 14 months.
