To compare Commercial Vs. Residential Construction we are looking at Commercial spaces which most often include objects, such as huge office buildings, large-scale multifamily housing, land investments, storage buildings, rental spaces, and industrial buildings. Residential spaces include condominiums, detached or semi-detached houses, duplexes (triplexes, fourplexes), and housing units in general. Some of the main differences between commercial and residential buildings apply to the construction process and the material being used. Let’s examine those differences closely. Commercial Vs. Residential Construction both certainly have to adhere to specific rules and regulations from the municipality the property is being built in. However, commercial properties also have pre-set rules regarding the materials used in construction, as well as the electrical systems, plumbing, the size and design of the object and construction techniques. Commercial buildings also need to adhere to certain industry standards regarding safety concerns as well as IT concerns, elevators, parking lots and garages as well as handicap accessibility. In residential construction, the majority of these elements are rather optional and some of them – like elevators – don’t even make the final cut. When materials are concerned, the main difference between commercial and residential construction can be spotted in the type of material used for the structure’s frame. While residential properties usually feature a timber frame, because it is considered to be the most cost-effective, commercial properties usually feature a steel frame. As a general practice, most buildings use mild steel. This material is durable, easy to fabricate, and offers great temperature resistance. Companies that hire mild steel fabrication experts get excellent results in terms of longevity and cost-effectiveness because steel frames allow for larger, taller, and more complex designs. As already mentioned, the customizability of design is certainly a major aspect that sets these two types of construction worlds apart. While in commercial construction everything needs to be in accordance with pre-set norms and regulations, the residential construction allows for far more creativity and personality to be implemented in the design. There are plenty of features to consider when building a new home, and you can customize each of them to fit your specific personal needs. From wallpapers and wood paneling to eco-friendly features such as solar panels – you can perfect every little detail until you create your personal paradise. The cost differences between these two types of construction are significant, even when talking about buildings of a similar size. Things like the materials used and obtaining the necessary permits are just the tip of the iceberg differences here. What makes the biggest difference in prices are the number and quality of the people working on the project, as well as the equipment used in its construction. Additionally, the way in which either of these projects is being funded varies significantly. The construction of commercial properties is usually funded by a government agency, a corporation with bank financing, or a wealthy individual, while funding the construction of the residential property is usually funded by the future homeowner. The way in which the homeowner manages to secure the necessary budget most commonly involves bank loans, insurance loans, or straight out cash the homeowner managed to secure over time. As mentioned earlier, the equipment used in the process of construction also makes a huge difference. For instance, commercial properties usually require heavy machinery, like cranes and earth-moving equipment, to be used as well as other specialized equipment. For ultimate safety and the quality of the final result, these machines need to be operated exclusively by skilled professionals. On the other hand, in residential construction, only the most extravagant of houses will require just a portion of the machinery to be used. Furthermore, it is no secret that future homeowners very commonly choose to DIY some parts of their homes, which makes the entire process last significantly shorter and eliminates the need to get it entirely completed. Finally, the potential mistakes made in residential construction are far lesser in scale and can be remedied far more easily; in commercial construction, not only is there no room for error, but any potential mistake can lead to a hefty lawsuit in the best-case scenario. In general, the differences between residential and commercial construction mostly boil down to the scope of the project itself, as well as the overall costs and the type of materials and machinery that’s being used. However, there are certainly other differences as well, that include the wiggle room when drifting off of the industry norms is concerned, as well as the overall customizability of designs.
