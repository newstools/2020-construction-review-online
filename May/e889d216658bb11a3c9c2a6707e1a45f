The Government of Ghana is to embark on the construction of a concrete bridge over the Chemu Lagoon to connect Ablekuma West and Ablekuma South constituencies in Accra. This was revealed by Mohammed Adjei Sowah, the Metropolitan Chief Executive of Accra Metro. Mr. Sowah said that the contractor has already secured the site and that is expected to begin the actual construction works this week. He also mentioned that upon completion the bridge will not just be a footbridge but a drive-through bridge connecting to the Dansoman area from Chorkor.

Thereâ€™s normally high traffic on this corridor and the footbridges breakdown made it even harder for the people who use it frequently. The Metro chief executive described the situation as a scary adventure for the people in the area and particularly the school children. Mr. Sowah defined the new bridge to be constructed under the Coastal Development Authority as a very significant project. The new project was announced during a cleanup exercise organized by Zoomlion Ghana Limited to desilt gutters and drains within the community to avert flooding. The gutters and drains chocked by waste materials are believed to be one of the causes of the floods which led to the collapse of the former footbridge. A team from the exercise also inspected the ongoing dredging of the heavily choked Chemu Lagoon by Dredge Masters, a subsidiary of the Jospong Group of Companies. The Minister for Works and Housing Samuel Atta Akyea and MP for Ablekuma South Alfred Oko Vanderpuije, were also present at the cleanup exercise.
