A 100MW solar energy facility is set to be constructed in China by Amazon. This is one of five renewable energy projects the company is planning around the world. The Chinese facility which will be built in Shandong is expected to generate 128,000 megawatt hours of power each year. The other facilities will be built in Australia and the US as part of Amazon’s Climate Pledge, a commitment to be powered by 100% renewable energy by 2030. The solar projects will power Amazon’s fulfillment operations and energy-hungry cloud business. In the US, Amazon’s two new projects in Ohio include a 200MW solar project and an 80 MW solar project. Additionally, there is a new 130MW solar project in Virginia. Once enabled, these three US based projects have the capacity to power the equivalent of 69,000 average US homes each year. In Australia, a 105MW solar project in New South Wales will have the capacity to generate 250,000 MWh of clean energy each year, which is enough to power the equivalent of 40,000 average Australian homes.

These projects totaling over 2,900MW of capacity will deliver more than 7.6 million MWh of renewable energy annually, enough to power 680,000 U.S. homes. Despite those efforts, there has been pressure inside Amazon and from other environmental advocates for the company to adopt more extensive sustainability programs. In particular, the activists want Amazon to sever ties with fossil fuel companies that use the company’s services.
