The 167,000-square-foot building is located along Dolorosa Street east of Interstate 35 and is a major component of the university’s downtown campus expansion plan. The project is expected to spur business in the area and attract private investment. Corrina Green, director of major capital projects and real estate for UTSA while giving an update on the proposed School of Data Science and National Security Collaboration Center said they have already finished developing the project design. eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_1',142,'0','0']));UTSA officials are awaiting design approvals from the UT System Board of Regents before commencing construction in mid-December. The project is expected to be complete by July 2022. The building design has tried to draw more attention to a reimagined San Pedro Creek. The center’s ground level will be reserved for a café plus a large mixed-use space that will be used by students and tenants and also available for public events. “We really want to draw people into the building and up from the creek so that we are interacting with the other development that’s happening around us,” Green said. “We’re working hand in hand with all of these developers to make sure that this is very engaging with what they are doing.” eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_3',146,'0','0']));UTSA also announced plans to construct a 250,000-square-foot Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Careers Building at the site where the county’s old prison is being demolished. The building will start west of the new structure that is being constructed. The University is yet to release the timeline for the Innovation, Entrepreneurship, and Careers Building whose construction is expected to cost $161.2 million. This building will house an expanded College business.
