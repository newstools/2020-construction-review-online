Primera Cos recently commenced construction of Towne Square II offices in Plano, one of a few search groundbreakings in the midst of the pandemic. The 80,000-square-foot building will be located near the southwest corner of State Highway 121 and Preston Road. The new project joins another one that the developer completed three years ago. In a statement during the launch Primera Cos.,’ Randy Sutton said it has taken almost a year to put the deal together. He added that the land was initially earmarked for hotel development. Sutton said Towne Square II offices will include small tenants and office suites and all will come pre-finished and ready for occupation. In total, the project will have around two dozen office suites sized between 2,000 and 5,000 square feet. There will also be two shared conference rooms. “The suites in the new building on average are a little bigger,” Sutton said. “We are trying to retrofit for today’s environment — touchless elevators, automatic doors, and clean air that we think is going to be important.” The building, which was designed by O’Brien Architects is expected to be launched next September. Wading through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic Sutton said they are happy with the progress made noting that have had to adopt measures that sustain construction in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s portfolio, according to Sutton is mainly a mix of industrial and office space. He said that although they have had to come in to address the needs of some tenants during the pandemic, the company’s cashbooks were not affected so much. Town Square II becomes the second major construction to launch in the last couple of weeks even as the second wave of the pandemic rages on. Just recently, Cawley Partners, another developer, broke ground for a 120,000-square-foot building on the Dallas North Tollway near Windhaven Drive. Upon completion, the project is slated to become the new headquarters of First United Bank’s mortgage company.
