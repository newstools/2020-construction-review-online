Dallas-based developer KDC has joined the team that is working on Frisco’s $10 billion Fields project. It is a section of the team behind the wildly successful Legacy West project in Plano.  The company was already part of the team that planned the 2,000-acre Fields project. The project is being developed by Fehmi Karahan. KDC will work on the project with CrossTie Capital Ltd, Chief Partners LP, Republic Property Group, Karahan Cos., and Hunt Realty on the mega project located in Frisco and which is expected to cost more than $10 billion. The massive commercial and residential community is being developed on the Dallas North Tollway. Other projects that KDC has worked on include Legacy West’s office campuses for JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual Insurance, and Toyota. Dubbed the Fields project, the development will involve the construction of more than 10,000 homes plus up to 10 million square feet of commercial space. Around 500 acres of the project was sold to PGA of America on which it intends to construct its new headquarters, an Omni resort hotel, and two golf courses. A large commercial district will be developed along the Dallas North Tollway. KDC is one of North Texas’ most successful real estate companies and commercial developers and is known for working on corporate offices for several companies like Baylor Scott & White, Pioneer Natural Resources, and State Farm Insurance. Toby Grove, the KDC president said the Fields project will be the company’s next big development in North Texas. “We think it’s a tremendous opportunity and a great piece of property,” Grove said. “We are looking at the overall master planning and providing input for the corporate users.” According to Grove, the ownership of Fields property will guarantee its development to high standards. He noted that is a big opportunity for the company to be working on the project.
