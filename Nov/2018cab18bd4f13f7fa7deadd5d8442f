The related memorandum of understanding was signed on Wednesday the 4th of November in Kinshasa between the Central African Country Minister of Infrastructure and Public Works, Willy Ngoopos, and Zhou Bing, the representative of the majority Chinese state-owned, publicly-traded, multinational engineering and construction company primarily engaged in the design, construction and operation of infrastructure assets, including highways, bridges, tunnels, subways, airports, oil platforms, marine ports and railways, especially high-speed rail.

The paving works on this road, which is currently impassable and more especially during the rainy seasons, will link and facilitate transport between the towns of Kisangani and Bafwasende in the province of Tshopo, Nia-Nia and Mambasa in the province of Ituri, and Beni in the province of North Kivu. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_8',117,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_9',117,'0','1']));The road is also a part of a proposed linkage to the neighboring Republic of Uganda. Once fully complete, this strategic corridor will connect the center and northeast of the DRC to the port of Mombasa in Kenya, thereby promoting the development of transport infrastructure and the economy of the DRC in the sub-region as well as enhance security in the eastern region of the Central African Country.
