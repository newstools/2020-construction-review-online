Upon completion in 24 months’ time, the project is expected to secure the electricity supply to the inhabitants of the towns of Mouila and Ndéndé in the province of Ngounié, as well as to the populations of Tchibanga, in the province of Nyanga in the south of Gabon. It will also help to strengthen and secure the Interconnected Network (RIC) of the Louétsi department in the Ngounié province. The over US$ 12.7M project, which also includes the construction of a drinking water plant at Val Marie, is funded by the SEEG under its 2020 emergency water and electricity plan. The drinking water plant is planned for construction at Val Marie, approximately 3 km from the town of Mouila in Ngounié. The plant, which should be inaugurated by the end of March next, will have a capacity of 3,400 m3 of water per day. Within the 2020 emergency water and electricity plan framework, the SEEG also intends to construct an additional drinking water plant in the council of Atsié. This is expected to be inaugurated by the end of June this coming year and it will be capable of treating 3,400 m3 of water per day.
