The Government of Kenya has commenced the tarmacking of the seven kilometers of Juja Farm road that connects Juja town to Juja farm in Kiambu County. Funded by Kenya Rural Roads Authority (KeRRA) to a tune of over US$ 35M and to be constructed by H.Young, the road will use low volume technology and will be completed within a span of six months. Speaking during the commissioning of the project State Department of Infrastructure Principal Secretary, Paul Maringa, said that the road is a major bypass through Ma-store, Athi, and Gatuanyaga in Thika and that in the coming budget, the government shall extend the construction to the remaining 28 kilometers through to Komo, Githima and the Garissa Highway.

The project is expected to end the decade of a perennial headache to residents over its poor state and enhance connectivity to the many industries, schools, and residential areas that are coming up in Juja Farm. PS Maringa said that the road will only accommodate smaller trucks for its durability and that it will be equipped with weighbridges to prevent heavy trucks from destroying it. On the other hand, present at the commissioning ceremony, Kiambu Governor James Nyoro assured the locals that they will get casual jobs during the phase of construction and that local quarry will provide building stones and other raw materials for the construction of the road creating income opportunities for the operators. Other roads being constructed in the Sub County are the extension of the Kenyatta road and the tarmacking of the Bob Harris road.
