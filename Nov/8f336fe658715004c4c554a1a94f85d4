The construction works in this section were carried out by 5 local companies namely Tensor systems, Masimba Holdings Limited, Fossil contracting, Exodus & Company and Bitumen World. The five firms were given an initial 20km stretch each along the highway. The field works consisted of the progressive dualization of the track (the rehabilitation and widening of the existing road from the current width of 7 m to about 12.5 m) as per the Southern Africa Transport and Communications Commission (SATCC) standards. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',142,'0','0']));Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Engineer Joel Biggie Matiza during the commissioning ceremony expressed satisfaction with the ground covered by the five firms that are rehabilitating arguably the country’s busiest road in terms of vehicular and human traffic.

Better yet, it will facilitate the transit of goods to countries such as Zambia, Tanzania, and the DRC.
