The 1.3 million square foot is located near the Springfield-Branson National Airport and I-44. The new Amazon distribution center is expected to employ up to 500 workers upon its completion.

The distribution centers are the first spot in the order’s journey from the warehouse to the customer. At its sorting centers, the e-commerce giant offers both part-time and full-time jobs. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_6',143,'0','0']));Amazon has already started hiring for the distribution center with jobs starting at $15 per hour. Construction work on the project is expected to be complete in the coming summer. In a comment, Acting Mayor Matt Russell said the center will have a big impact on the City of Republic as well as entire Missouri. “We are proud to have been selected as a partner with Amazon. Given the city employees’ hard work and a constant drive to be “open for business,” this sort of growth was only a matter of time in happening,” he said. Plans are underway to have the community’s transport infrastructure improved in the order to handle the projected increase in traffic. The Missouri Department of Economic Development, the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce, the office of Missouri Governor Mike Parson, and the Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) are still in talks to revamp the community’s road network.
