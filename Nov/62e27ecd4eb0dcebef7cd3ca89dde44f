Currently, the land is owned by developers Ron Stallings and Robin Miller who bought 16 parcels of land to make the block in 2006 and 2007. The land was bought through a company called Jackson Commons Partnership LLC. Greta Harris, CEO at Better Housing Coalition said they located the site as they were looking for more development opportunities in the city.  “We were made aware of this site assemblage that had been done years ago, and timing is everything,” Harris said. Harris a deal to purchase the property is expected to be sealed by the end of the year. He added that the location is very strategic for the company because is surrounded by major transport channels.
