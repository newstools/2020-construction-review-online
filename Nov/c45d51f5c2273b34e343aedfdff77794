The permit was filed at the city’s planning department which also reviewed and approved grading and foundation-only permits for the same project. Amazon’s names is not indicated anywhere in the paperwork neither has the e-commerce giant openly identified itself with the project. Named “Project Fireball-GEG2”, the massive 1.3 million-square-foot Amazon-like facility is located at 18007 E. Garland Ave. in the city’s northeast industrial area. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',142,'0','0']));A spokesperson from the company was recently quoted saying the company “is constantly exploring and weighing a variety of factors when deciding where to develop sites to best serve customers, but doesn’t provide information on its future roadmap.” eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_2',143,'0','0']));There are however several clues that point to Amazon as the main developer. First, Amazon is known for using code names on projects that are still in design states. There are speculations about Amazon’s involvement with Project Fireball. It should be remembered that Amazon’s fulfillment center called GEG1 was named Project Rose during its early stages of development. A number of companies working on Project Fireball have worked with Amazon in the past, further fueling speculations that the retail company is behind the project. For instance, Chicago-based Clayco Inc has been listed in documents filed at Spokane Valley city. The same company worked partnered with Amazon to develop 17 fulfillment centers across the U.S. These centers range between 500,000 and 1 million square feet. In October this year, Irvine, California-based Panattoni Development Co. Inc entered into an agreement to redo a section of Garland Avenue. The final deal is set to be ratified after a public hearing scheduled for November 17. It is not yet clear what will be built beside the relocated road.
