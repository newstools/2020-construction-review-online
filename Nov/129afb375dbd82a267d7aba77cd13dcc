In totality, NWR has a long-term three-phase approach to complete the rail-link that will start in Chingola and head west through the Copperbelt close to the DRC border eventually connecting Zambia to Angola and the Benguela railway. Phase 1A includes the construction of the first 166 kilometers of the railway which will link the existing North-South Rail Corridor at Chingola to the new Solwezi Freight Terminal and connect with the recently upgraded D-271 road to Kipushi on the DRC border thereby creating a new export corridor for Katanga mining production. The project is in line with the Zambian Government initiative to move over 30% of heavy freight in the country by rail, thereby reducing the amount of heavy freight on public roads. It is envisaged that upon completion, the project will unlock economic growth and export revenue generation opportunities in the Copperbelt, and northwest region known for its mining and agricultural exports.
