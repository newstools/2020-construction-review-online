Darifair Foods has commenced the construction of its new Corporate Headquarters and Innovation Center facility. Located at 13129 Flagler Center Parkway, Atlanta, USA the 47,500-square-foot facility will feature a working test kitchen, a research and development lab, a pilot plant, a show kitchen, an integrated sensory and market research department, and a quality control lab. The company anticipates completing the construction of the new facility in late 2021. In a press release, CEO Andy Block said the construction of the new facility is a big milestone in the company’s five decades of operation. He added that the company has evolved and is currently well developed and advanced compared to 35 years ago when it was established. “For five generations our family has owned and operated food and dairy companies, but the Darifair we know today is completely different than the one we started 35 years ago. We’ve advanced in so many ways and Arbor supports our vision for continued innovation; this facility is a huge nod to that commitment,” said Andy. The company intends to use the facility to accommodate its departments like offices, customer service, marketing sales, and finance and supply chain. It will also have a rooftop entertainment area and meeting rooms. In a comment on the project, Darifair president Midd McManus said the new headquarters will offer additional space to support future growth and organizational needs. The new facility is being constructed on a 5-acre parcel off of Gran Bay Parkway. The company bought the land for $2.1 million in January. Darifair Foods has contracted the Stellar Group to design and construct the new headquarters. The contract secured a $15 million foundation permit for the project in mid-August. In addition, the Stellar Group was given $13 million permit for the construction of the facility in late September. Matthew Design Group had initially designed the facility and came up with a 37,250-square foot facility.
