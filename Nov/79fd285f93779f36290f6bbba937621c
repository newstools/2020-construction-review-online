Construction of the new Geauga county offices is ongoing along Merritt Road and Ravenwood Drive in Claridon Township. The project was recently flagged off by the Geauga commissioners. The maximum cost of $17.5 million for phase two of the new Geauga county offices was approved by the county commissioners during the regular weekly seating.  The cost cap will be accompanied by performance and payment bonds from Donley’s Independence, LLC. Following the approval of phase two of the project, commissioners went ahead and held a groundbreaking ceremony for the project. In a brief statement during the ceremony, commission board President Tim Lennon said “this has been a long journey, but [it’s] exciting to get to this point.” He added that “this is something that should have been addressed a long, long time ago, but I’m excited to be a part of it and doing it now.” The controversial plan to relocate the county offices When it was first announced, the plan to move Geauga county offices from Chardon Square, which is the headquarter met some opposition from a section of Chardon city officials. Dave Lair, a former County Administrator lauded the board for finally launching the project. Mr. Lair was a county administrator for 14 years and recently was a member of the Newbury Local School District Board of Education. The entire project is expected to cost around $27.2 million. In an earlier presentation, County Administrator Gerry Morgan noted that the county did not have to go back to the voters to approve the bond as the project is within the county’s means. Mr. Lennon noted that they were very conservative in pricing the project. There is an ongoing tussle on between commissioners and the City of Chardon, which urges that some county functions should be retained at the original offices. The case is ongoing in the Geauga County Common Pleas Court.
