The Department of Municipalities and Transport (DMT) has launched the second phase of Mina Zayed re-development project which is a comprehensive renovation plan to redevelop designated areas of the iconic Mina Zayed area, and transform it into a new tourist, commercial and residential destination. As part of the first phase of the project, the master plan has already been completed and so has the design for a proposed fish market whose construction is underway. Out of use outlets and stores in the wharf area have also been demolished. Within the last week of this month Modon Properties, which has been appointed by DMT, will begin carrying out the demolition of the Meena Plaza Towers in collaboration with a leading demolition company. A pilot test was carried out earlier this year by DMT, Modon, and the demolition company to ensure the highest levels of safety, assess the amount of explosive material required, prepare the necessary protection specifications for volatile substances, analyze and measure vibrations and the noise level caused by the demolition, and secure the site.

Aldar Properties will also play an active role in this urban regeneration project, where it will develop prime land plots in Mina Zayed, spanning a gross floor area (GFA) of approximately 1.5 million sqm, as a seafront destination. This strategically-located project, adjacent to a vibrant cultural hub and a logistics center, forms an integral part of Aldar’s future development plans and is in line with its ongoing commitment to developing key destinations that contribute to Abu Dhabi’s long-term growth. It will help foster trade and investment operations in the capital, as well as support the urban development of Abu Dhabi while safeguarding the nation’s authentic identity and heritage.
