The project is being developed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC), one of Africa’s largest state Oil & Gas Company, in cooperation with Seplat Petroleum, an independent indigenous Nigerian upstream exploration, and production company. Both partners hold 50% of the venture. The gas plant will process natural gas from SEPLAT’s OML 53 onshore block, which covers an area of 1,585 km2 onshore in the northeastern part of Niger Delta. The block contains the producing Jisike oil field and the Ohaji South gas and condensate field. Ohaji South will be developed alongside gas finds in the adjacent OML 21 block, comprising the Assa North-Ohaji South (ANOH) project, one of the largest Greenfield gas condensate development projects being undertaken in the West African country by ANOH Gas Processing Company (AGPC).

This program aims to launch several production areas, as well as treatment plants, in order to eventually resolve the difficulties of access to electricity for local populations. Upon completion within the last quarter of next year, the natural gas plant will produce approximately 300 million standard cubic feet per day (mscf/d) and is expected to drive the next phase of growth for the gas business. It is also expected to provide about 30% of the gas supply in the West African Country. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_0',117,'0','0']));Highlighting the importance of the project, Hope Uzodinma, the governor of Imo state urged the two partners to, at the same time, “  provide jobs, scholarships, and basic necessities to the population  ” of the locality.
