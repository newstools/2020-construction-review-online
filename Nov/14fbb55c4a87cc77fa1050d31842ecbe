Telecom Egypt, Egypt’s first integrated telecom operator and one of the largest subsea cables operators in the North African region has announced that it is currently building Egypt’s largest international data center facility. Expected to be commissioned in early 2021 with access to all the global submarine cable systems that land in the North African country, the new data center is going to be the first in the country with the Uptime Institute‘s certifications in the Design, Constructed Facility, and Operational Sustainability categories. The new data center will be connected to all of the 10 Mediterranean and Red sea subsea landing stations, giving it access to more than 60 countries around the globe. The recently acquired Tier III Certification of Design from the Uptime Institute guarantees that Telecom Egypt’s customers will receive the highest levels of availability and technical resiliency.

This will further contribute to the development of sustainability features that mitigate the rising costs of energy and are closely aligned with international standards. The facility’s capabilities target organizations that value premium data center services and consider risk management and lower latency as benchmarks when it comes to selecting data centers. This facility has the capacity to house up to 2,000 racks over a 4 Colo Modular Facilities Campus. This project corresponds with the country’s efforts to expedite the development of ICT infrastructure and digital services as well as contribute to the regional digital transformation.
