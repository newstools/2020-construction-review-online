After approximately 18 years lull in getting a concessionaire for the BILT which was previously known as Boankra Inland Port, the Ashanti Port Services Limited, a consortium of Afum Quality Limited of Ghana and DSS Associate of South Korea, finally won the bid to bring life to the project.

Upon completion, the BILT will be an ultra-modern integrated logistics terminal consisting of a Container Service Yard (CSY), Container Freight Station (CFS), Reefer, Warehouses, Truck Parking Area, Trucker’s Facilities, Fuel Station, Commercial Complex, Freight Forwarders Offices, and facilities for postal, telecommunication, utility services, among others. It is expected to increase the movement of goods and services in the country and also facilitate transit trade between Ghana and the landlocked neighboring countries such as the republic of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. Speaking during the sod-cutting ceremony, President Akufo-Addo said that the implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) would be buoyed by the construction of the BILT which will ensure “an effective and efficient transport system, especially as Ghana is playing host to the Secretariat.” The President was hopeful that the BILT and other similar infrastructure projects, such as the development of the Keta Port, the Tema-Akosombo Railway Line, and the ongoing port expansion projects in Tema and Takoradi Ports, would make a positive contribution in ensuring that Ghana derives maximum benefits from the AfCFTA.
