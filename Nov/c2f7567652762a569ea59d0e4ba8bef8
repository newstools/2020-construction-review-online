This comes following the approval of the company’s environmental management plan, the easing of Covid-19 restrictions, and the completion of the final cultural ceremonies in the Muzarabani and Mbire Districts.

The successful discovery of oil or gas in Muzarabani will represent a humongous achievement for the southern African country, which is at often times plagued by budget deficits and resource constraints to fund development and key infrastructure projects. If either oil or gas is found in Muzarabani, the Government of Zimbabwe will get a share of the production, usually, 50-70 percent of the entire output or proceeds thereof, once the investor has recouped their investment. Apart from exports and the tremendous job creation potential of the project, the Muzarabani oil and gas project would also bring about a cocktail of downstream benefits in the form of new industries, energy security infrastructure development. Invictus Energy said that discussions with multiple farmout parties are ongoing on the drilling process for the Cabora Bassa (Muzarabani) Project which has passed technical review/assessment and is now undergoing commercial evaluation, above ground due diligence, and detailed forward program costing (including drilling cost).
