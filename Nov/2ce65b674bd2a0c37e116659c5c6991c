The Ministry of Education and the PNG have already signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that allows PNG to support the Ministry through ensuring access to education by the six communities in the park’s buffer zone. The MoU, signed by Education Minister Carmelita Namashulua and the Gorongosa Programme Chairperson, Gregory Carr, also covers the implementation of programmes intended to improve not only school access, especially for girls, but also learning quality as well as the strengthening of institutional capacity.

We are happy with the programmes envisaged, especially because they place girls in the limelight,” she added. The rules and standards include technical specifications for resilience to tropical cyclones, drought, and earthquakes, and management of the Covid-19 respiratory disease.
