30 years of R&D – with unwavering innovation: PLANBAR and TIM have become indispensable tools for thousands of precast CAD designers, engineers and operations schedulers worldwide. The latest software releases further strengthen offerings in a future-proof branch of industry – and once again prove eye-opening. With greatly expanded automation features in design and planning, the software also helps to prevent accidents in production and assembly. PLANBAR is the world’s top CAD solution for designing and detailing precast concrete parts – easy to learn, with time-saving assistants and smart features that make 3D as easy as 2D. Together with TIM, PLANBAR is iconic for its ability to provide precise and efficient precast designing, process planning and production planning. The most popular features include reinforcement at a click, generating automatic element plans, and 3D stacking. Why do we continue to tirelessly develop these two software solutions to provide even greater efficiency and precision, despite functionality that has been a proven success for years? eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'constructionreviewonline_com-medrectangle-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));“We want to make the most efficient even more efficient, the most precise even more precise, and the most secure even more secure. After all, we see our tools as an essential success factor to help our customers improve their competitive edge and productivity,” states Werner Maresch, Managing Director at PRECAST Software Engineering, explaining the roots of the new, powerful features. “We are particularly proud of the innovative quality assurance tools that can help prevent time-consuming errors and even accidents – if, for example, the risk of tipping occurs when stacking, our software triggers an alarm.” Another focus in the development of the new versions, in addition to efficiency and security, was on quality assurance of data for production and business systems. “Quality-assured data and its smooth flow ensure maximum possible efficiency in precast projects,” explains Peter Kafka, mathematician and BIM pioneer at PRECAST Software Engineering: “This means you need both – features that improve efficiency and 100% commitment to seamless data quality. Ultimately, error-free data are also a precondition for maximum cost and time efficiency – replacing defective parts in a new production run eats the most into margins, and our software helps to ensure that designs are correct.” PLANBAR and TIM 2021 – redefining long-term reliability For the newest versions of its smart software products, PRECAST Software Engineering – the leading international full-service provider of software solutions and services for the precast concrete industry – once again spared no effort or expense: A total of 150,760 hours – and that is only the recorded hours, not counting the ideas bandied about at all hours by our enthusiastic developers – went into the next development step. What does it consist of? The new releases provide more than 4,500 production upgrades and new features to provide even better performance in PLANBAR and TIM and efficiency never before seen. One example of this is the new TOPIC BOARD, available in PLANBAR and TIM, which greatly simplifies cross-departmental collaboration, saves time and provides even better flow in precast projects. What specific added features can we expect from the upgrade on 07 Dec 2020? Customers who already use PLANBAR and TIM will be happy about the noticeably improved performance, more openBIM, and further advanced automation options. 4,500 new features, even more automation – although the whole has always been more than the sum of its parts and a smart integrated solution cannot be summed up in a few words, the info box provides an overview of the new highlights of PLANBAR and TIM from PRECAST Software Engineering, part of the Nemetschek Group.
