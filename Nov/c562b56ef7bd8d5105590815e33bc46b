The government of Namibia has set aside about US $1.8m for the construction of a state-of-the-art neonatal unit and a mothers’ shelter at Swakopmund. The unit is expected to have a 28-bed capacity which will be divided into 12 standard care beds, six high-care beds, six intensive care beds and four isolation unit beds. The unit will have doctors’ consulting rooms as well as on-call rest rooms.

This arrangement will provide the mothers with the space and privacy they need to get to know their new babies and to assure them that they will be nearby while their babies receive the highest level of care,” she added. The prime minister also confirmed that the positions for paediatricians as well as other specialised vacancies required for neonatal care unit will be advertised and filled before the construction of the unit is completed. Construction of the facility is expected to be completed by February 2022.
