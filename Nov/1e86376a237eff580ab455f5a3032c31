The Texas Department of Transportation has kicked-off the 635 East Project, which involves the rebuilding and widening of the I-635 Corridor and the I-30 Interchange in Dallas County.  The Department recently held a virtual groundbreaking ceremony also attended by federal, state, and local leaders. The launch of the 635 East Project is a calumniation of efforts and planning that started five years ago.  Among those who addressed the virtual meeting are U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, Texas Department of Transportation Chairman J. Bruce Bugg Jr, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins, Garland Mayor Scott Lemay, Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson, Mesquite Mayor Bruce Archer, among other state, county, and local leaders. Investment in infrastructure In his statement to the virtual gathering, Governor Abbott said the state takes priority in investing in infrastructure as a way of revamping the economy. He added that the rebuilding and widening of the I-635 Corridor and the I-30 Interchange will help create jobs and decongest the communities. He lauded Texas Transportation Chairman J. Bruce Bugg Jr and other commissioners for their steadfast leadership to tackle traffic problems in the state. On his part, Chairman Bugg said, “I’m proud to add my voice to the chorus of support for funding and moving forward with 635 East.” He added that “this project will improve safety and will bring immediate and long-lasting relief to one of the worst bottlenecks in Texas.” Scoop of work The 635 East Project will involve building continuous frontage roads on I-635 from U.S. 75 to I-30. The scoop of work will also include expanding and rebuilding the mainlanes from eight lanes to 10, and reconstruction of all cross streets. There will also be major roadway enhancements and improvements like updating roadway designs to meet required standards as well as implementing wider cross streets to increase traffic capacity.
