A portable PV plant with a combined production capacity of 2.9 MWp has been launched in the port city of Tuléar, the capital of the Atsimo-Andrefana region in Madagascar. The project was carried out by Akuo Energy, the French leading independent power producer (IPP) focused on renewable energy, in collaboration with Enelec, the energy unit of Filatex Group, a leading renewable energy, real estate, and free zones business based in Antananarivo, Madagascar. The Portable PV plant is made up of 44 of Akuo’s Solar GEM containerized “plug and play” units. Each one of these units comprises 200 solar PV panels with the capacity to produce nearly 66 kWp.  They are also pre-assembled and pre-wired and they can therefore be deployed in just 30 minutes and folded up in 45 minutes.

Requiring an investment of approximately US$ 7.1M, the project received long-term funding from Atmosfair, an independent German non-profit organization based in Bonn and which offers offsets for greenhouse gases emitted by aircraft, cruise ships, long-distance coaches, and events. The project will not only provide electricity to the inhabitants of Tulear contributing to the local government’s objective to extend energy access to 70% of the population by 2030, but it will also help the port city to go green in its energy production.
