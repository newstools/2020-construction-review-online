Lendlease and IHG Army Hotels recently completed the construction of a cross-laminated timber hotel at Fort Jackson in South Carolina. Lendlease and IHG Army Hotels were the first to build a hotel using CLT and have since developed four in the U.S. The new CLT building is the first phase of the Candlewood Suites which are under construction at Fort Jackson. The first phase of the project involved the construction of the 171-room West Building, which was constructed from 5,203 pieces of black spruce CLT. The project’s East building is a 146 room facility under construction and set to be unveiled next spring. Lendlease and IHG Army Hotels have a large portfolio of hotels across the U.S with more than 13,000 rooms on 40 U.S military bases. The two companies opened a 311-room facility last July in Fort Gordon, Ga, the largest Candlewood Suites hotel in the world. The current project, which includes the cross-laminated timber hotel is being developed under the Privatization of Army Lodging (PAL) program and is the 14th Candlewood Suites hotel that has been developed under the PAL program. Lendlease and IHG Army Hotels have been in charge of Fort Jackson’s lodging since 2013 under a public-private partnership. In 2009, Lendlease took over the ownership and management of over 3,200 hotel rooms in 10 Army bases. This came to be the first agreement under the PAL program. The PAL program is an initiative led by the U.S. Army and which seeks to revitalize lodging for soldiers and their families. In addition to the cross-laminated timber hotel that was launched recently, Lendlease and IHG also developed Holiday Inn Express hotels and Staybridge Suites under the PAL program. Lendlease is the main developer under the PAL program under an agreement signed with the U.S. Department of Defense.
