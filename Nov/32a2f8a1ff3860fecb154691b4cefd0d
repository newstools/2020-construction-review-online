For achieving a clean energy future and cut down the greenhouse has emissions, many leading US cities have been striving hard to meet the goal. The American Council for an Energy Efficiency Economy (ACEEE) analysed 100 cities, and New York City emerged as a leader bagging the #1 position in the annual scorecard for the first time in 2020. NYC with their clean energy initiatives including local laws, energy code and incentive programs were able to score 77.5 points out of 100. Boston and Seattle were tied for the second position with 73 points, and Minneapolis and San Francisco were tied for the fourth position with 72.5 points. The scorecard found out that out of 100 analysed cities, only 63 cities have GHG reduction goals, while only one-fifth (20) cities were on track with their goal. The annual ACEEE scorecard rates the energy efficiency performance of cities based on the following 5 main areas, with the maximum achievable score of 100: Local Government Operations – 10 points
