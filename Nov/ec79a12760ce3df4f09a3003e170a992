Amazon is putting up a massive distribution center in north Fargo. In a recent virtual meeting, North Dakota offices as well as the project developers said the facility will create more than 500 jobs for local residents. Those who attended the meeting include U.S. Sen. John Hoeven, Gov. Doug Burgum, Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney, and Minneapolis-based developer Ryan Companies, which is building the fulfillment center. The developer, Ryan Companies is also putting up other Amazon fulfillment centers in other areas like Tucson, Ariz. and Sioux Falls, S.D. The 1.3 million-square-foot building is being constructed near Fargoâ€™s Hector International Airport. The structure will sit on around 110 acres and will be located in the area of 37th Street and 40th Avenue North. In his comments, Mahoney said the whole project is expected to cost between $100 million and $120 million. It is in the same range as another development called Block 9 project that is being constructed in downtown Fargo and which is also expected to be an Amazon fulfillment center. According to an Amazon spokesman, workers at the facility will get a base salary of $15 per hour and will have other benefits like a 401K retirement plan and health insurance. Speaking on behalf of Ryan Companies, Dan Mueller said around 350,000 cubic yards of material has been hauled at the project site. According to officials who attended the virtual meeting, Amazon did not get any monetary incentives for the project. Amazon official said one of the reasons that made the retail giant select the location was the ease with which federal, state, and local officials were able to process regulatory documents. Mike Flannery, regional director for Amazon said they are optimistic the fulfillment center will be able to attract talented and qualified employees. Local businesses have perennially complained of lack of qualified workers to hire. The distribution center is expected to open next year.
