Construction of a new science and technology building as well as the renovation of an adjacent building on the Oakland Community College Auburn Hills campus is making impressive progress. The two buildings are expected to be completed next fall. The project will involve the construction of a new 54,000 square-foot building as well as the renovation of another 31,000 square-foot Building C which is adjacent to the new one. The renovated building is expected to replace the existing computer and science laboratory. In a statement, OCC Chancellor Peter Provenzano Jr said “This new addition and renovation will provide us with a state-of-the-art learning and teaching environment for our students and faculty.” Provenzano Jr added that the school is happy to offer students one of the most advanced state-of-the-art labs in the state. He added that the lab is a demonstration of the school’s quality of the curriculum and talent. On his side, Oakland Community College Board of Trustees Chairman John McCulloch said the new facility will be of great benefit to the community. He added that there is a big demand for science and technology talents in the job market. The new facility will be used to prepare students with the best STEM education available. Features in the new science building will include new active-learning classrooms, a cyber-security lab, and labs for microbiology, physics, biology and chemistry, CIS labs, offices, conference rooms, and collaborative study spaces. The new building will be joined to the existing Building C through a connector on the second story. A new mechanical tunnel will be constructed to connect the existing utilities. A central stairway will be constructed in the connector to allow access to the main corridors of the Auburn Hills campus. In a comment on the project, Bobbie Remias, Vice Chancellor for Administrative Services said the project was completed on time thanks to the favorable weather and fewer people on campus.
