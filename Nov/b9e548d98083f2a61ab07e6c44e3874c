The U.S. Navy has taken possession and moved into its new headquarters at 750 Pacific Highway opposite the San Diego Bay. The 373,000 square-foot Navy One Building will accommodate around 1,450 employees who are expected to move into the new facility by November 20. The new building replaces the 1920s-vintage headquarters building that the U.S. Navy has been using and which will be brought down early next year. The federal agency first indicated its intentions to move out its administrative personnel out of the 1920s-era, waterfront warehouses in 1980. It is the first phase of an experimental public-private partnership that has been around for 40 years. The Navy One Building will be the headquarter for Navy Region Southwest Reserve Component Command, Naval Facilities Engineering Command Southwest, and Navy Region Southwest. The location will be a big shift for the workers with access to several amenities like a fitness center with 3,300 square feet of indoor-outdoor space, plenty of break areas, and new working desks. The Navy One Building has a deck on the 17th floor, which allows Navy personnel to have a better view of the city. Other amenities will include conference rooms on every floor, a barbershop, a self-service market, and additional outdoor patios and balconies on the first and ninth floors. There are also water stations and zero-touch hand sanitizers throughout the entire building. The building also has 459 underground parking spaces and is installed with a high-speed elevator which takes only 35 seconds from the ground to the top floor. Finally, there is an expansive restaurant on the first floor which is open to the public.
