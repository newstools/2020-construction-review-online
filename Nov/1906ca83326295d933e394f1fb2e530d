Vonjy Andrianmanga, the general manager of Jirama said that with this project the company aims to improve the quality of the electricity supplied to its customers and above all to reduce electricity production-related costs. “The installation of these power plants will play a key role in the improvement of the supply of the interconnected network of the capital city of Madagascar,” he affirmed. The use of renewable energies is a major component in the recovery strategy of Jirama, whose financial resources are heavily strained by the purchase of fuel for its thermal power plants. Madagascar has large solar energy potential. Almost all the regions of the East African country receive over 2,800 hours of sunshine per year, with the daily solar radiation ranging from 1,500 to 2,100 kWh/m2. PV systems are currently utilized for powering public buildings such as health clinics, as well as off-grid community electrification solutions.
