A solar-powered desalination system has been commissioned in Cape Coast, the capital city of the Central Region of south Ghana, after 24 months of research and development.  The facility is specifically situated at the Philip Quaque School, the oldest school in the West African country. This location was chosen with the help of Technik ohne Grenzen e.V and the local people. The project was developed by Grino Water Solutions, which with the help of Safeflex way water technologies Limited was able to construct a borehole from which a pump drags about 8 m3 of water per day. The facility is also equipped with 24 photovoltaic solar panels that can provide up to 8 kW power per day, thanks to Energiebau Sunergy. The solar system is mainly used to power an installed desalination system that is capable of supplying about 3,000 liters of drinking water per day.

It is also used for daily electricity consumption such as lighting or charging of electrical devices. This project is financed by Innovation und Zukunft Stiftung (Manfred Schmitz, Barbara Schmitz). According to Grino Water Solutions, about 30% of the water produced at the facility will be sold to the people at an affordable price to compensate for the small maintenance costs and ensure the sustainability  of the project. This pilot project for Grino will benefit approximately 600 high school students and almost 400 people living around the two schools. The company plans to partner with local communities and other companies to disseminate its desalination technology where people do not yet have a secure source of drinking water supply.
