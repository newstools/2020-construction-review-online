The M.D explained that the financing, amounting to a total of at least US$ 2bn might be available in a year or less. “In a year or less, the funding will be on board and we expect the construction works to begin in the first or the second year following the conclusion of the negotiations.

On the other hand, earlier this month the finance Minister for Uganda Mr. Matia Kasaija, said that the government contemplates extending the railway line to South Sudan in the case of availability of funds. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_1',117,'0','0']));“Being the cheapest means of transport, railway investments need to be prioritized. If we rehabilitate the meter-gauge railway all the way to Tororo and if money allows us, we may have to build it up to South Sudan,” he said. South Sudan is an integral part of Uganda’s export market being the second-highest destination after the republic of Kenya. The country, in last year, earned Uganda approximately US$ 351.5M. Therefore, extending the railway line would reduce the cost of exports to the country and consequently increase Uganda’s export earnings.
