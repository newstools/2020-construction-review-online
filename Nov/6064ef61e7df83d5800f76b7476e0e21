It will also include a 24/7 emergency department and services for critical care, surgical, mental health and addiction, kidney care and dialysis, and testing and research. When complete, the Hospital will span 1.3 million square feet on a 49.8-acre greenfield site. Upon opening in 2027, the hospital will be one of the first Canadian healthcare facilities to achieve WELL certification. Designing to WELL standards prioritizes the health and well-being of the staff, patients, and visitors by focusing on 10 concepts: air, water, nourishment, light, movement, thermal comfort, sound, materials, mind, and community. As an integral part of a connected healthcare system, the new facility will improve the patient and caregiver experience and strengthen access to local services.
