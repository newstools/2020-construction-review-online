The Perdekraal East site is located 80km northeast of Ceres in the Western Cape and the Kangnas wind farm is situated near Springbok in the Northern Cape. The wind farms are equipped with a total of 109 2.3MW capacity onshore wind turbines and will help provide enough clean electricity to power a total of 250,000 South African homes. Additionally, wind farms will emit zero carbon emissions using almost no water during the power generation process.

Mainstream fully developed the projects, managed the construction process and will manage the operations and maintenance of the plants. The global developer of renewable energy is based in Dublin with offices in Cape Town. Kangana’s wind farm was even completed significantly ahead of schedule. As part of the “Bid Window 4” of the government’s Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme (REIPPPP), both Perdekraal and Kangana’s wind farms will together add to the 1.3GW of the country’s clean energy generation capacity. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'constructionreviewonline_com-box-4','ezslot_4',117,'0','0']));
