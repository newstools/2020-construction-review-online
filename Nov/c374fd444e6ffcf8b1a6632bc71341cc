The government of Kenya through the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), the autonomous road agency responsible for the management, development, rehabilitation, and maintenance of Class A, B, and C roads in the East African country, is set to commence the construction of a fly-over at the T-Mall junction on Langata road. On its Twitter feed through a public notice signed by the agency’s Director-General Mr. Peter Mundinia, KeNHA noted that the project consists of the upgrading of the Langata-Mbagathi-Mai Mahiu crossing by means of a four-lane flyover on Langata Road, and the expansion of the adjacent roads.

With the commencement of the construction works, KeNHA has announced that sections of Langata Rd and Mbagathi Way shall be narrowed. “Pursuant to Traffic Act Cap. 403 sec. 71, KeNHA wishes to notify the general public that sections of the Langata Road and Mbagathi Way, contiguous to the TMall Roundabout area shall be narrowed by means of fences, to allow construction works on the existing road medians and shoulders,” read the statement in part. “‘We, therefore, request motorists to exercise caution around the area and to comply with the Traffic Management Plan signalization and instructions given by the traffic marshals,” it concluded. Upon completion, the envisioned T-Mall flyover will allow vehicles headed to Ongata Rongai and Magadi to pass over an elevated road to the Shell Petrol Station next to the Wilson Airport. Vehicles headed to Mbagathi Road, South C and Wilson Airport on the other hand will use the underpass. The Project, aimed at terminating traffic jams at the busy Langata Rd, was conceptualized under the Public-Private Partnership between the Government of Kenya and its Spanish counterpart.
