Expectations for the project Promoted by the West African country Ministry of Energy and Water, the new transmission line is expected to augment the country’s power transmission network capacity. It will help reduce load-shedding, especially during the hot summer months, in Bamako and other beneficiary cities. It will also form the basis of electrification of over 100 villages, apart from being the backbone for electricity exchange between Mali and the neighboring countries such as Ghana and Burkina Faso.
