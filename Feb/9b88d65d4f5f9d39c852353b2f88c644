The Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly, in Nigeria has rejected a proposal to construct a nuclear power plant in the state. The house vehemently rejected the proposal for the project which is to be located at Oku Iboku community in Itu council of the state; and urged the state government not to release any parcel of land for it. This is after a motion was tabled by Hon. Kufreabasi Edidem, a member representing Itu State Constituency, citing that the project was not in tandem with international standards guiding the implementation of civil nuclear programmes across the globe. According to him, despite warnings from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that Nigeria lacks the technical competence to handle nuclear issues, the National Atomic Energy Commission (NAEC) has not relented in its decision to proceed with the nuclear project in Itu.

Nse Essien, Member representing Onna State Constituency, rejected the planned nuclear power plant, urging the Federal Government to instead of the dangerous venture, explore other available and harmless sources of power in the state, including increasing the capacity of the Ibom Power Plant, yet the regulatory body was still adamant on its establishment in the state,” he said. He further cited constant emission of radioactive radiations, discharge of non-biodegradable radioactive wastes, absorption into the ecosystem and food chain, as some dangers Akwa Ibom people would be exposed to if the nuclear power plant is indeed constructed in the state. The Speaker, Aniekan Bassey while responding to the motion, commend Hon. Edidem for the timeliness of the Motion and urged the Clerk to communicate the resolution of the House to the appropriate quarters.
