It will also enable the laying of 135 km of new primary and secondary pipelines throughout Greater Tananarive (town and urban area), mainly in the outlying areas. In the central districts of the Malagasy capital, at least 44 km of degraded pipelines will be built. The population will be supplied with water through 400 standpipes that will be built in the suburbs of Tananarive. Jirama will also make 500 domestic connections to the drinking water distribution network. Under the project, rehabilitation and extension of the Mandroseza 1 drinking water station with the replacement of hydraulic equipment will also be done. This will include, creation of a new reagent room and new pumps for drawing water from the Ikopa. Rehabilitation of Mandroseza II and II bis drinking water stations will follow with the construction of a new treatment unit (40,000 m³) per day. The EIB will provide US $39m while European Commission, US $33m. Part of the funds will be earmarked for technical assistance for the project. According to EIB, the project will contribute to five of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), namely drinking water and sanitation, poverty eradication, good health and well-being, gender equality and sustainable cities and communities.
