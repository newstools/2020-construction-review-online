Expansion and reconstruction of the Roberts International Airport (RIA) highway in Liberia is to be completed in 3 years. Public Works Minister Mobutu Nyenpan confirmed the timeline and added that, when completed, the RIA road will be transformed into an ultra – modern four – lane highway with all requisite lighting and road safety facilities and features. “This project has a duration of three years, and it’s expected to be completed and dedicated on July 26, 2023,” he affirmed. President George Weah recently broke ground for the commencement of the 45km road project estimated by Public Works officials to cost about US $95m. According to President Weah, the RIA highway is the most convenient route for movement of people, goods and services to and from six of Liberia’s 15 counties including Margibi, Grand Bassa, River Cess, Sinoe, Grand Kru and Maryland.

He further commented that road connectivity is a core pillar of his Administration, and it is the function of the Pro – Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development. “My government’s infrastructural development programs have the strong support of international development partners, and I would like to express my appreciation to the partners for the support and I assure them of utilizing resources put at government’s disposal for their intended purposes,” he said. According to Mr. Nyenpan the mobilization of funds for the project was initiated and concluded by President Weah’s government. “The initial funding is being provided through negotiations by the ECOWAS Bank for Investment and Development and also from private sector capital,” he added.
