US $13m has been approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) of Nigeria for the Benin-Adumagbae-Igba-Akure road in Edo and Ondo State. Minister of State for Works and Housing, Abubakar Aliyu confirmed the report and explained that works had stopped due to lack of funding. He affirmed that the contract has been reviewed and the contractor will resume works. “We have inherited the project  and reviewed the contract from the original sum of US $10m inclusive of VAT and tax, an increase of about US $4m. It was then further reviewed down through the processes of going to BPP to the total sum of US $13m,” said Abubakar Aliyu.

The rainy season and poor equipment pose challenges to road maintenance.[ Similarly, the government is pursuing a strategy of partial port privatization by granting concessions to private port operators so that they can improve the quality of port facilities and operations.
