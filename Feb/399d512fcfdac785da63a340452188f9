According to the authorities, the iron content of the water from this borehole has been tested and meets the current standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO Chad). It was confirmed to be less than 0.3 md/l.  However, to avoid too high an iron content in the water, linked to the composition of the soil at the groundwater level, the pipes will be regularly cleaned. The facility will benefit nearly 110,000 inhabitants located in the south of the country in the province of Moyen-Chari. Moreover, two additional boreholes to improve the service will be constructed. Chad has one of the lowest rates of access to safe drinking water and sanitation services in the world. While access to safe water and sanitation is improving in urban areas, children in rural areas are almost always at risk from these water and sanitation-related diseases. According to the latest studies, close to 16,000 children under 5 die each year of diarrhoea, and these deaths are largely caused by contaminated water, lack of access to proper sanitation and poor hygiene practices. 40% of urban areas have access to drinking water while in the rural areas it is 32%. It is an ambition for which the Chadian government intends to make the necessary resources available.
