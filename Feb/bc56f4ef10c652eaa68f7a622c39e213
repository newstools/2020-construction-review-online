A 150 kWp solar power plant funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCCF) has been developed in Kunene region of Namibia. Minister of Environment and Tourism, Pohamba Shifeta confirmed the report and said the plant marks the beginning of a new era in the fight against the effects of climate change in Namibia. “The challenge for the country is to achieve the objectives of renewable energy and energy efficiency,” said Pohamba Shifeta. The solar power plant is part of a project called “Community Based Natural Resource Management in Namibia, Enhanced Direct Access (CBNRM EDA)”. This is an initiative launched by the government a few years ago to combat the effects of climate change. It is fully funded by the United Nations (UN) Green Climate Fund (GCF) to the tune of US $9m Also Read:500MW solar power plant to be constructed in Uganda The power plant is set to provide 9,200 people in the Kunene region, one of the most arid regions in the country, with access to electricity. Namibia has enormous potential for solar energy production. The country is the driest on the African continent, with 300 days of sunshine per year. However, Namibia’s largest solar plant is a 45.5MW facility built by Spanish company Alten Energías Renovables. The project was developed by a joint venture between Alten, NamPower and Namibian solar companies Mangrove, Talyeni and First Place Investment. The nation’s other operational solar parks each have less than 5MW capacity and are spread across Namibia. The country is aiming for 70% of its installed electricity capacity to come from renewable sources by 2030.
