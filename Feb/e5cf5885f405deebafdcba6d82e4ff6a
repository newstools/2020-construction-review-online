The government of Rwanda has announced plans to develop its first central sewerage system in its capital city Kigali. Dominique Murekezi, Water and Sanitation Cooperation (Wasac), responsible for planning the water and sanitation infrastructure revealed the report and said the aim is to improve wastewater management in the country. The project is is part of Rwanda’s Sustainable Water Supply and Sanitation Programme. Its objective is to improve the quality of life and socio-economic development of Rwandans by ensuring equitable provision of “adequate, reliable and sustainable” water and sanitation services in several cities in this East African country.

The network will direct wastewater to Gitikinyoni. It is in this part of the Nyarugenge District that a treatment plant with a capacity of 12 000 m³ of wastewater per day will be built. The government estimates that the treated water could be reused, notably for irrigation and watering the many green spaces in the city of Kigali. They have however warned that implementation of this collective sanitation project will cause the displacement of many families settled in the city of Kigali. “A comprehensive study has been carried out to determine who will be affected by the project, their economic and social status and how best to minimise the impact. It started in December 2018 and so far we have identified 114 families,” said Dominique Murekezi. The overall cost of the project is estimated to be US $125m and will be financed in form of loans from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the European Investment Bank (EIB).
