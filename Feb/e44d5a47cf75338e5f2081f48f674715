In the same vein, new pumping stations were also built, a reservoir (2000 cubic metres) and a water tower (500 cubic metres) rehabilitated. All these facilities will be managed through a remote management system. Benin’s Minister responsible for Water and Mines, Samou Seidou Adambi, inaugurated the new infrastructures on behalf of Benin’s National Water Company (Soneb). According to the Minister, the project which was financed by the West African Development Bank, will see the country achieve a 90% water distribution rate in the beneficiary area by 2024. Overall, these infrastructures reinforce Benin’s national water company distribution network in the city of Parakou, increasing the production capacity from 400 m3/h to 1800 m3/h. Similarly, the length of Soneb’s water network has increased from 445.3 km to 758 km. Reinforcement of the drinking water supply system in Parakou and its surroundings began in 2018 to cope with a fast-growing population and the region’s rapidly expanding urbanization. The existing plant was exhausted and had trouble providing a reliable service able to meet the changing needs of the inhabitants.
