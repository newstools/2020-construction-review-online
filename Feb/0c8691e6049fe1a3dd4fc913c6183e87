Expansion and reconstruction of the Roberts International Airport (RIA) highway in Liberia has begun. This is after President George Weah broke ground for the commencement of the road project. The 45km road project estimated by Public Works officials to cost about US $95m is expected to transform the current two – lane road to a modern four – lane major highway from ELWA to RIA. According to President Weah, the RIA highway is the most convenient route for movement of people, goods and services to and from six of Liberia’s 15 counties including Margibi, Grand Bassa, River Cess, Sinoe, Grand Kru and Maryland. “Some of these counties are hosts to several multinational corporations such as FireStone and Golden Veroleum,” he said. He further commented that road connectivity is a core pillar of his Administration, and it is the function of the Pro – Poor Agenda for Prosperity and Development. “My government’s infrastructural development programs have the strong support of international development partners, and I would like to express my appreciation to the partners for the support and I assure them of utilizing resources put at government’s disposal for their intended purposes,” he said.
