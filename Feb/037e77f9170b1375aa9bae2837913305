The entire project, which is funded by African Development Bank, will cost more than US $3m. The completion of the sewer system will pave way to desilting Chinga dam. The dam supplies water for consumption for residents of both Othaya and Mukurwe-ini constituencies. According to Mr. Irungu, it stands on 153 acres but has now accumulated silt with water now remaining on only 50 acres. The first phases will be done this financial year while the subsequent phases will be completed in the coming years. Upon completion, the sewer will be useful to local investors who are building multi-storey houses to meet the growing housing demand. The project is also expected to improve water supply and access to sanitation in Kenya as the government aims to achieve 70% water coverage by 2022. According to the government, water coverage has increased by 1.5% in 2019.
