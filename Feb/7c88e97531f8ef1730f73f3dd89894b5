US $23m has been disbursed by Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) to the country’s 60 Rural District Councils (RDCs) to to facilitate the continued rehabilitation of rural roads. Zinara acting chief executive officer Engineer Moses Chigonyati confirmed the report and said that the money is part of a US $38,4m resource envelope for rural roads. He further pointed out that the Government considers the country’s road network as vital to promoting industry and commerce, especially as the country primes itself to attain upper middle-income status by 2030. “We had budgeted US $38,4m for rural road rehabilitation and of that amount, we have disbursed US $22,7m to 60 RDCs. Some of the RDCs started surfacing their centres (growth points) using the money we gave them and are also in the process of gravelling their road networks,” said Eng Chigonyati.
