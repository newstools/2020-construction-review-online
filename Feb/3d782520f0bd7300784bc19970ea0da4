The US $30m Chemususu Water Supply Project in Kenya is almost complete. At least more than 30 water reservoirs in Eldama Ravine, Mogotio in Baringo County and Rongai Sub-County in Nakuru are 65% complete. According to Water, Sanitation and Irrigation Chief Administrative Secretary Andrew Tuimur, at least 10 reservoirs of different capacities were ready, while others are in various stages of construction. “We want to make sure that the project is completed by June so that residents in these areas can start enjoying access to clean and uninterrupted water supply,” he said during an inspection of the project. The CAS toured at least four reservoirs in Kabarak, Kiptoim, Kelelwa and Eldama Ravine before inspecting construction of a mega treatment plant at the US $55m Chemususu Dam. Already pipes have been laid from Chemususu Dam to Mogotio. Also Read: Niger to receive US $33m to extend water supply network “We want to serve people as far as we can. We want to reach as many people as possible. It is a big project and more than 600,000 people are going to benefit,” said Tuimur. President Uhuru Kenyatta and DP William Ruto commissioned the 45-metre high dam with a capacity of 12 million cubic metres of water in 2017. It is expected to serve residents in Esageri, Solian, Muserechi, Kabimoi, Saos and Rafiki. More than 20 reservoirs are in Baringo County while the rest are in Nakuru. The project seeks to alleviate the perennial water shortage experienced in parts of Nakuru and Baringo counties.
