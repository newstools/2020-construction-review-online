Construction for the 40,000 seater Al Thumama Stadium in Doha, Qatar; which will be one of the grounds for the 2022 World Cup and a symbol for the Qatari and Arab culture, is well underway and on schedule. It will be located in the south of Doha. The exterior design for the structure is currently complete. The Al Thumama was designed to embody the style of a “gahfiya”, which is a traditional headdress worn by men in Arab countries, particularly in the Gulf region. The gahfiya forms an important part of every young boy’s path to adulthood. The arena is a symbol of Qatar’s youth and the shared Arab heritage that inspired its creation.

It will host World Cup games until the quarter-final stage and is one of the stadiums built exclusively for the competition, with its capacity to be reduced by half when the tournament concludes. The seats will be dismantled afterwards and will be donated to countries that need them the most. Hassan Al Thawady, the Secretary-General of the Legacy Review Committee, recently announced the opening of the Education City and Al Bayt Stadiums mid this year, and is certain that both the Al Thumama and Al Rayyan Stadiums will follow suit and be unveiled six months later, when the indoor facilities, pitch and remaining works are finished.
