The 79-year-old concrete bridge over the Okye River collapsed on September  2019 after the river overflowed its banks following a downpour resulting to the construction of the steel bridge. The bridge links nearby communities in the Asikuma Odoben Brakwa and Birim Central districts in the Central Region and the Birim South District in the Eastern Region.

In addition the government of Ghana has partnered with Ghana Armed Forces, to construct 5,000 steel bridges nationwide in bid to facilitate economic activities in the country. The Minister of Roads, Kwasi Amoako-Attah said the ministry has solicited the collaboration of 48 Engineers Regiment of the Ghana Armed Forces towards the construction of the bridges. “The move to construct the steel bridges falls under the ‘Ghana beyond Aid’ initiative which seeks to develop Ghana’s economic development beyond aid and the collaboration between the military and civilian employees is a step towards the implementation of the vision,” said Amoako-Attah.
