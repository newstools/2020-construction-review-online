China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and Qatar Petroleum have officially signed a US $2.86bn contract for the construction of LNG carriers at CSSC Hudong-Zhonghua Shipbuilding in China. It is the largest export LNG carrier construction contract a Chinese shipyard has ever received. CSSC Chairman Lei Fanpei, Saad Sherida AI-Kaabi, president and CEO of Qatar Petroleum and the Minister of State for Energy Affairs signed the contract online on behalf of two parties. Qatar Petroleum, the world’s largest LNG producer, launched the tender for LNG carrier construction last year, which is expected to deliver 60 LNG carriers initially to support its increasing LNG production capacity, with a potential expansion to construct 100 new LNG carriers. According to Saad Sherida AI-Kaabi, Hudong-Zhonghua is doing well in LNG carrier construction. “We are confident that Hudong-Zhonghua will greatly support our LNG carrier expansion demand,” he said.
