The Mississippi Public Service Commission (MPSC) in US has approved the construction of a 100MW solar power plant in the state by Recurrent Energy LLC a wholly owned subsidiary of Canadian solar. The company had entered into a Build-Transfer agreement with Entergy Mississippi to build the approximately US $138.4m Sunflower solar photovoltaic project. With the signing of the BTA, one of the first signed in the US, Entergy will own the largest solar power plant in the state of Mississippi. Recurrent Energy will develop the Sunflower solar project, located on approximately 1,000 acres of land in Sunflower County, Mississippi. The project will use high-efficiency modules from Canadian Solar and single-axis trackers.

We are proud to do our part to expand the use of clean renewable energy from the sun in Mississippi, and to advance the goal of building an environmentally-friendly, low-carbon future,” he said. Construction of the solar plant is expected to create approximately 360 jobs and the plant will begin commercial operation by mid-2022. Once operational, Entergy Mississippi will own the Sunflower project, allowing the regulated utility to power more than 16,000 homes with clean electricity. Entergy Mississippi President and Chief Executive Officer Haley Fisackerly said that, once the Sunflower Solar Facility is complete, the company will be able to offer renewable energy as part of customers’ energy mix.
