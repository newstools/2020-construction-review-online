Tanzania’s Bus Rapid Transit Project is entering into the third phase with the government of Tanzania releasing around US$2.5M to be used to compensate Dar es Salaam residents who will be forced to leave their properties so as to make way for the projects implementation. This was revealed by William Gatambi, the Dar es Salaam Rapid Transit Agency (DART) public relations manager. Mr. Gatambi mentioned that a huge percentage of the total amount has already been paid but US$53, 562 still remains unpaid due to complications associated with inheritance in some areas. “We are however working to resolve the problem and as soon as that is done the compensation will take place,” explained the DART public relations manager.
