The Egypt, Sudan joint electricity grid has officially commenced operation. Egyptian cabinet made the announcement and said that the grid operation is the first stage of electric interconnection with Sudan through which Egypt seeks to provide the neighboring state with electric capacities up to 70MW. The interconnection project was part of Cairo’s efforts to become a regional energy hub by serving as an electricity conduit for Arab, African and European countries. Egypt already has electricity connections with Libya and Jordan and is planning to connect with Greece, Cyprus and Saudi Arabia.

Through the long-term goal of maintaining 15,000MW of surplus power, the project could aid future development in other Nile basin countries. Egypt initiated this programme years ago to further improve access to electricity throughout the country. Through this programme, the North African country hopes to increase the share of renewable energy in the country’s energy mix to 42% by 2035. Sudan committed to releasing about US $20m of the US $31.74m total cost for the grid, which will cover 1,000km. The state-owned Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company and Indian construction firm Larsen & Toubro were tasked with the undertaking’s implementation. Egypt is among the few African countries that have already achieved 100% access to electricity. The country has a renewable energy capacity of 5.5GW, with a large share of hydropower (2.8GW) and the rest (2.7GW) divided between solar and wind power. Nevertheless, the government wants to install 61GW of green power plants by 2035.
