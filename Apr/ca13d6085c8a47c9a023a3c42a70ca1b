Dyason’s Klip 2 solar project one of Scatec Solar’s three solar power stations on the Upington complex, located in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa is now fully complete. This is after the Norwegian Independent Power Producer (IPP) recently completed the construction and connection of Dyason’s Klip 2, the third and the last plant in the complex Dyason’s Klip 2 solar project, like the two previously commissioned plants, has a capacity of 86 MWp, representing an annual production of 217 GWh. With this capacity, the plant is capable of supplying electricity to approximately 40,000 South African homes. In total, Scatec Solar’s three solar power stations have a capacity to generate about 258 MWp, enough to connect 120,000 South African homes. These installations according to Scatec Solar, prevent the emission of 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.
