Facilities Management Solutions (FM Solutions), a subsidiary company of the AFMS Group, is proud to announce that Zaahir Forbes has been promoted to the position of company Director. Zaahir joined the company in 2012 as a Construction Project Manager and until recently fulfilled the position of General Manager – Facilities. His new position comes with increased areas of responsibility and requires the running of the FM business, along with his fellow Directors. “It will require much more strategic input into the business and initiatives to ensure sustainable business for future growth,” Zaahir says. However, he is excited about the new challenges the promotion will bring, as he describes himself as somebody who is constantly striving for success. An avid cyclist who also enjoys running, playing soccer and engaging in volunteer work, Zaahir believes that the FM industry should be further recognised in the built environment as the value of FM services cannot be understated. “FM is a key enabler for business and plays an important role in the built environment disciplines – especially at planning stages of infrastructure development. The variety that the job brings, along with the tangible results that we are able to achieve for our clients, create a huge sense of accomplishment. It creates excitement and work satisfaction that I wouldn’t trade for anything,” Zaahir concludes.
