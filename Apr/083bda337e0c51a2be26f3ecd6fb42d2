Alberta Health Services (AHS) and the government of Alberta have selected Scantec to design and construct Alberta’s first temporary COVID-19 treatment Centre at the Peter Lougheed Centre in Calgary. The facility, donated by Sprung, will house up to 70 patients and will add over 750 square metres  of treatment space. The temporary treatment facility will be turned over to AHS on April 27, 2020 to begin equipment installation, and patient intake preparation. Stantec is providing design and engineering services for the temporary pandemic response facility. In addition to leading the architecture and interior design support (furniture and equipment sourcing), Stantec is responsible for electrical, structural, and mechanical engineering. Working directly with key user groups including physicians and nurses, Stantec has led health care planning services to ensure the temporary centre supports AHS treatment practice while keeping patients and health care providers safe.

The temporary COVID-19 treatment centre is an example of the entrepreneurial and charitable spirit that defines Alberta. Sprung Structures has generously donated the structure, valued at approximately US $235,000. The Calgary Zone has 63% of Alberta’s confirmed COVID-19 cases. The temporary facility at Peter Lougheed Centre will be ready to accept patients in advance of the predicted COVID-19 peak in mid-May.
