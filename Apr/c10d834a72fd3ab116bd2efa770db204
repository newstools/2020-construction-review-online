The proposed development comprises almost 6,000sqm of mixed creative, retail, leisure and workspace, and over 900 new homes with a mix of private sale and build to rent apartments that will help to meet the local housing need. Also included in the proposal is a 133-bedroom hotel that occupies a key location overlooking the proposed Skypark on Duddeston Viaduct and a new public park called ‘Pump House Park’; named after the former Victorian Pump House, a vital piece of canal infrastructure and the inspiration for a large new industrial art installation by renowned local artist Tim Tolkien. According to Cole Waterhouse CEO Damian Flood, the company is committed to delivering a high-quality design which enhances the surrounding environment and community. “Our vision is to create a new neighbourhood right in the heart of Digbeth and neighbourhoods need communities, culture and connectivity to thrive and prosper so this has been a driving factor in the development of our plans,” he said. He further added that the company has worked really hard to involve the local community as much as they possibly can and look forward to this next stage of the process. “Now that the planning application has been made we will be moving into the funding phase of the project whilst we move through the planning process and await a decision,” he affirmed.
