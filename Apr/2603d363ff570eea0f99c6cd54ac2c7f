The government of Ethiopia has announced plans to develop five water and irrigation infrastructures. This is after they awarded the project contract to Water Ways Technologies, an Israeli agro-technology company. The projects estimated to cost US $851,000, will involve construction of water supply and control systems for a polymer plant in northern Ethiopia and the upgrading of a water store close to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. A dribble irrigation system on 12 hectares in central Ethiopia will also be installed. This will be utilized to irrigate an avocado plantation. Shade net structures and irrigation hardware will likewise be installed for a vegetable farm also in central Ethiopia.

Parts of Ethiopia face water shortages, poor sanitation, and a lack of access to clean water sources. Ethiopia is located in Africaâ€™s Horn where drought is a leading causes of water shortage. In the past twenty years, droughts have affected several areas of the country, leading to ponds, wells, streams and lakes drying up or becoming extremely shallow. In a study conducted by Water.org they found that 42% of the population has access to a clean water supply and only 11% of that number has access to adequate sanitation services. In rural areas of the country, these figures drop even lower, resulting in health problems in the villagers as well as their animals.
