Construction works on the new M4 metro line in Milan, Italy has resumed. Italian construction companies Salini Impregilo and Astaldi announced that they have resumed their work after the Municipality of Milan and M4 Company along with other operators involved in the project introduced all the necessary measures to protect the health of their personnel from COVID-19 infection, as they proceed with the work. Some of the safety measures adopted by the companies include checking the body temperature of every worker at the start of the day, at lunchtime, the use of masks, the distribution of hand sanitizers and disinfectant gel dispensers, enforcing the safe distance rule, cleaning and disinfection of work sites, dorms and common areas, etc. The number of people who can travel in the same vehicle to and from the site has also been decreased to reduce the risk of disease spread.

Other measures are still in force such as presidential decree that allows for infrastructure work such as the construction of M4 on the condition that procedures, checks, protective gear are enforced to protect the health of workers and prevent the spread of the contagion. According to Salini, work has started on all the three sections of the metro line including east, west and central and preparations are on to begin excavating with large tunnel-boring machines (TBMs) by next week. Currently, about 200 workers, employees and managers have resumed their work to bring the new metro line in the shortest time possible.
