A 150MW wind power farm is set to be constructed in Northern Iowa, US by White Construction, a subsidiary of Infrastructure and Energy Alternatives (IEA) that manages utility-scale renewable energy and heavy civil infrastructure projects. IEA recognized approximately US $56m of this contract in backlog at December 31, 2019. Upon its anticipated completion in November 2020, the US $65m wind farm will produce roughly 600,000 megawatt-hours of electricity each year, or enough energy to power roughly 70,000 homes. White Construction will self-perform all of the engineering, procurement and construction needs of the project, including the building of access roads, the erection of wind generators, the installation of turbine foundations, and the construction of project substations and a medium-voltage collection system.

Iowa is a national leader in wind energy, ranking second in the U.S. for installed wind capacity. Iowa was also the first state to produce more than 30% of its electricity from wind. Wind construction projects, including that of this newest wind farm, will bring Iowa well over 10,000 MW of installed capacity within the next few years, according to the Iowa Environmental Council. IEA has assembled more than 7,200 wind turbines across North America.
