A US $500m mixed-use condominium and hotel tower is set to be constructed in Los Angeles (LA), California US by Australian residential developer Crown Group. The 43-storey tower, which will be designed by Koichi Takada Architects, will feature 319 condominiums with an exclusive residents’ retreat over the top two floors. It will be built at the southeast corner of South Hill and 11th streets at the convergence of Downtown’s financial, fashion and South Park districts. According to Crown Group US development head Patrick Caruso, the development would offer buyers in Downtown LA an appealing point of difference as well as bring a new version of condominium living to the district. “We anticipate that this new mixed-used development, which will offer attainable luxury living with never before seen facilities including an exclusive rooftop residents’ retreat, collocated with a quality branded hotel will be very well received by those looking for a new condominium,” he said. He further added that, it is clear buyers are seeking more diverse offerings, so the fresh and unique Australian approach of functional resort style-living melded with sophisticated architectural design will fill a significant gap in the market.

A dramatic street canopy will ground the tower and incorporate a “breathing green wall”, designed to improve the city’s air quality and introduce a unique landscaping feature to the Downtown streetscape. To deliver the project, Crown Group has formed a joint venture with a Singapore-based Magnus Property and Indonesia’s property developer ASRI. The projected is expected to be complete in 2024.
