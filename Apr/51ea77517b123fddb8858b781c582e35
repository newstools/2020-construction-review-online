Solar power in Kenya to be boosted when a new 40 MWp solar photovoltaic power plant backed with a USD 0.075 per kWh feed-in tariff (FiT) is set to be put up in Kisumu County in the western region of Kenya by Ergon Solair Africa Ltd, a subsidiary of the American company Ergon Solair PBC. This is after the American company was issued with an approval to carry on the development of the project by the Energy Regulatory Commission of Kenya (Epra), the authority in charge of energy regulation in the East African Country.

Colacicchi, the founder of Ergon Solair said that they are thankful that the government of Kenya has endorsed the project. “We are certain that this project will boost numerous investments and activities, making a significant contribution to the sustainable development of the region. Moreover, it is more important at this complex moment in the world’s history to accelerate the development of solutions for a sustainable future,” he concluded. The agreement signed between Ergon Solair Africa and Epra allows the former to build its solar power plant on a more than 100 hectares roadside land in the locality of Kibos that will boost solar power in Kenya. It also directs the project’s developer to sell the electricity generated by the facility to the state-owned Kenya Power & Lighting Company (KPLC) under a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). The project has been on the cards for the last seven years and according to Ergon Solair Africa, the plant will be commissioned in the last quarter of 2023. Within the first year of operation, the plant is expected to have the capacity to produce approximately 105.3 MWh of electricity. It will be connected to the National grid through a 220 kV substation within its proximity.
