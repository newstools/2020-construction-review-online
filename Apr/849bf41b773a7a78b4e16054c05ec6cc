The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has awarded US $79m contract to US-based Granite Construction to construct the Highway 101: Carpinteria project in Santa Barbara County, California; US. The 17.5km project forms one part of five sections that will be built. The estimated construction contract value for the remaining segments is approximately US $400m. According to Granite executive vice president and chief operating officer Kyle Larkin, the project is critical to the safety and mobility of one of the state’s most congested highways. “As the Construction Manager/General Contractor (CMGC), Granite is proud to be partnering with Caltrans, Santa Barbara County Association of Governments and the City of Carpinteria on this project and pleased to see local and state tax dollars from Measure A and Senate Bill 1 being put to work,” he added.
