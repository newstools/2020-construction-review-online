Construction of the 250MW Amadeus wind farm in Texas, US is on track. This is after developer BayWar.e. Wind secured tax equity commitment from a consortium led by GE Energy Financial Services for the construction of the Wind farm. Additionally, the company had also executed a hedge agreement with Morgan Stanley and also closed a construction loan with Commerzbank. The Amadeus wind farm, which is located on 25,000 acres of federal, state and privately held lands, is expected to come into operation in the fourth quarter of this year. Once operational, the wind farm will generate enough clean energy to power 75,000 Texan homes annually while avoiding over 680,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere each year. The wind farm will be powered by GE’s wind turbines Due to its location, the wind farm is expected to have little to no curtailment or basis risk. The wind project is also claimed to be in line with its business model.
