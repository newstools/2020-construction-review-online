The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has agreed to provide US $404m loan to upgrade the intercity travel and cross-border connectivity in Bangladesh. The loan will be used to upgrade the national highway of the country N2 between Sylhet and the Tamabil border crossing. The upgrade will improve traveller safety and will also reduce the travel times for road users, as well as freight vehicles and buses. The Sylhet-Tamabil road, which is approximately 56.16km, is part of the Dhaka-Narsingdi-Sylhet-Tamabil National Highway corridor that has a total length of 286km.

Construction of the corridor is strategically important for sub-regional connectivity with seven north-eastern states of India, Bhutan, Myanmar as well as China. The funding will also be used for the construction, operation and maintenance of roads; as well as in institutional and project management support.
