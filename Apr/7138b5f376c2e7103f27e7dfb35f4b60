According to a statement from LTA said, when completed, the ITTC will be the cornerstone of Singapore’s strategy to sustain rail reliability and deepen core rail engineering capabilities. “Over time, the ITTC will also serve as a hub for LTA and the local rail industry to deepen our competencies in systems integration and operations and in maintenance, and to achieve engineering excellence,” the statement read. The ITTC is scheduled to be fully operational by end 2024 but the first phase will commence operations by the end of 2022. The operations will include receiving new trains and systems for Circle Line 6. In addition to helping in accelerating diagnoses and rectification of faults, the LTA expects the new centre to serve as the cornerstone of the country’s aim to sustain rail reliability while intensifying core rail engineering capabilities.
