The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has approved US $170m to improve the sanitation infrastructure of About 1.5 million residents in Bangladesh’s capital Dhaka. The Dhaka Sanitation Improvement project, co-financed with the World Bank, will support government investments in Bangladesh sanitation infrastructure comprising sewerage systems, sewage treatment, and pilot measures for hard-to-reach areas in the Pagla catchment, one of the most densely populated areas of the city. Children below the age of five in vulnerable households bear the highest burden of poor sanitation through morbidity, and the loss of productivity due to water-borne illnesses.
