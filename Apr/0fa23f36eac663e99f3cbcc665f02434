The Government of Mozambique and the African Development Bank (AfDB) have signed a protocol agreement for a US $34m grant for the paving of the 35km Nambungali-Roma road to facilitate trade and promote social inclusion of local communities. The works form part of the second phase of the Mueda-Negomano road project, which seeks to improve transport infrastructure between Mozambique and Tanzania. Mozambican Finance Minister Adriano Maleiane and Bank Country Representative, Pietro Toigo signed for their respective sides. The successful completion of the project will complement the recently constructed Unity Bridge to significantly reduce travel time to the ports of Pemba in Mozambique and Mtwara in Tanzania, and boost regional trade and integration between the two countries.

The project is also expected to foster social inclusion by stimulating employment opportunities along the corridor through sponsored vocational training and promotion of women-led businesses. The road project will be complemented by ancillary works to increase its social inclusion impact with an additional investment of US $2m in community markets, clinics and other social facilities. The Bank will also provide technical assistance to two sector agencies: Administração Nacional de Estradas (ANE) and the Fundo de Estradas (FE), giving them capacity to improve their operations. The Government of Mozambique will contribute US $536,000, mainly for resettlement and compensation.
