Phase I include: fencing, lightening, construction of reservoir and pit latrines. According to a statement from the Foreign Ministry, the objective of the construction is to decongest the corridor for easy movement of goods and people and also accelerate economic activities among the local population and its immediate surroundings. The statement also disclosed that the second phase of the project entails construction of a three storey market building which will have a parking lot, office space and a concrete garbage disposal site. The Modern Duala Market will accommodate a little over 5,000 marketers.
