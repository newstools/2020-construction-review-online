It features state-of-the-art technology and systems in the various stages of water treatment, coupled with the integration of advanced digital and information technology which aims to monitor the effectiveness of the site operations and to ensure the quality of water remains compliant with industry standard and client specifications. The facility is also equipped with laboratories for on-site water analysis and quality testing round the clock supervised by dedicated experts. It has a capacity of 1 million m3/day and it is expected to contribute to the irrigation of 70,000 acres of land in the Sinai, as part of the government’s efforts to develop the region by creating sustainable urban communities and job opportunities in the area. Last year, the project was named as the ‘Infrastructure Project of the Year’ at Dubai’s 2019 Construction Innovation Awards and it has been shortlisted for the ‘Wastewater Project of the Year’ award at the Global Water Awards, whose results will to be announced at the Global Water Summit in Spain.
