The government of Malawi is set to resume the construction of Kanyenga Health Facility in Mangochi Monkey Bay which was halted in 2015 after it withdrew the contractor from the site due to some legal matters. According to the Minister of Health, Japie Mhango, all is now set and the construction will begin as soon as June. “I am here to assure you that the project’s financing is secured and this time it’s under donor health joint fund unlike before when the project was being funded by the ministry; so from June this year we’re resuming the construction of the health facility,” said Mr. Mhango he visited the site accompanied by the Minister of Transport and public Works, Ralph Jooma who is also the Member of Parliament of Mangochi Monkey Bay.

In an interview with Mana on the resumption of the construction works, the Minister said the project was part of the government’s efforts to fulfill Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030 to ensure strong primary health care; the provision of essential health services at the community level; and strengthened health services. “It’s the President’s vision to institute health centres in each and every part of the country so that Malawians should stop travelling long distances in seeking public medical health care,” Mhango said. He further added that, this is what United Nations (UN) and World Health Organization (WHO) envisage in the vision 2030 for the Universal Health Coverage and this project is another step towards that goal. Mangochi Monkey Bay legislator, Ralph Jooma, said he had already started renovating road networks around the health facility area as a way of welcoming the project. He also hailed the resumption of the project saying it would help thousands of Malawians in the area who walk more than 40km to access public health services.
