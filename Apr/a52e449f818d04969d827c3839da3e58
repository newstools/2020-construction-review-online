The power purchase agreement was initially signed in December 2017 when the French company entered the country’s energy market. According to Meridiam CEO and Founding Partner Thierry Déau, the company is proud to support Ethiopia in its development. “The acceleration of investment in sustainable energy will be key to fight COVID-19 economic shock and job creation,” he affirmed. Construction of the project is being implemented by Tullu Moye Geothermal Operations Private Limited Company while the drilling work will be done by KenGen from Kenya. The first phase which is expected to produce 50MW is expected to be completed in 2023. The French company aims to produce 150MW from phase and two.
