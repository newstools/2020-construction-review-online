During South Africa’s extended national lockdown, aimed at helping to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Werner Pumps SA is open and able to assist municipalities and contractors to ensure essential services such as sewerage, wastewater treatment and infrastructure maintenance continues. “At Werner Pumps, our offices and manufacturing facilities have been given to remain open to assist our customers working in essential services, which include sewerage and wastewater infrastructure repair and maintenance,” says Sebastian Werner, Werner Pumps MD. “Proper sanitation is critical to prevent and control the spread of disease.” This is why the South African government has designated cleaning, sanitation, sewerage and refuse removal as essential services. Werner notes that this includes the maintenance and operation of water-borne sewerage systems, which is what the equipment manufactured by Werner Pumps is designed for. The company designs and manufactures high-pressure jetting and vacuuming equipment, which is also used in other essential service operations, such as controlling fly ash on the coal mines that fuel South Africa’s power stations. “We are available to service all our customers’ needs, including emergency spare parts supply and repairs, as well as to advise clients and facilitate sales orders for all Werner Pumps products,” he concludes.
