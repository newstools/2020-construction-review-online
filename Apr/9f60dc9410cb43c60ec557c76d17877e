The Falcon Junction upgrade project will involve the construction of 10 surface junctions and two bridges along Al Khaleej Street; and is scheduled for completion by the end of 2022. The first bridge will extend 750m northwards while the second will stretch 1,075m southwards. The project will also include the construction of a one-lane 250m bridge for right-turn from Khaled bin Al Waleed Street to Al Khaleej Street and also the construction of a two-lane 500m tunnel for left turns from Khaled bin Al Waleed St to Al Mina St, as well as a surface signalised junction linking Al Khaleej with Al Ghubaiba and Khaled bin Al Waleed Streets.

The contract for the Falcon Junction upgrade project is one of six contracts planned to be awarded under the Phase III of the project. The first two of the five phases of the Al Shindagha Corridor Project have been completed. Phase IV which will include the improvements along Al Khaleej Street is scheduled for completion by 2025, while Phase V which will involve the construction of southwards 1.5km bridges leading to Deira is expected to be complete by 2027.
