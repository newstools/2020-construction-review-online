World’s largest solar module production plant is set to be constructed in China by China-based solar manufacturer GCL System Integration Technology (GCL-SI). The US $2.5bn plant which will be built in Hefei province will have the capacity to manufacture 60GW of solar panels on an annual basis. It will also be equipped to produce 210mm high-efficiency modules. According to GCL-SI Chairman Eric Luo, this is another solid step in the dual-main business operation strategy. “GCL-SI welcomes upstream and downstream companies in the industrial chain to come to Feidong and build a super PV intelligent manufacturing base together,” he said.

The factory will also feature automatic and intelligent production technology with big data support. GCL-SI will build the project in four phases, each with a production capacity of 15GW, from 2020 to 2023. The first phase of the project, which is estimated to cost US $704m, is expected to be operational in 2020. GCL-SI currently has a module production capacity of 7.2GW, with products covering both monocrystalline and polycrystalline.
