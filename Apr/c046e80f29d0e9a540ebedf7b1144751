Construction of an off-grid 400kWp solar power plant by Ncondezi Energy in Mozambique has been suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has decided to suspend the project which involves building a solar power plant for a company in Mozambique, because it is not in a position to open the construction site due to the restrictions imposed by the Mozambican authorities to limit the spread of the dreaded virus. According to Hanno Pengilly, Chairman and CEO of Ncondezi Energy, despite the fact that the company is unable to cover the additional costs incurred as a result of the suspension of work, the project could be delivered in the second quarter of 2020 if the travel restrictions in force in Mozambique are lifted by May. “The company is working closely with all parties involved in the project. All major equipment is being deposited in secure storage facilities, ready for future deployment when the restrictions are lifted,” he added.

The facility will be equipped with a battery-based electricity storage system capable of storing between 28kW and 912kWh of electricity. Both companies will sell the electricity from the solar power plant to the beneficiary company over a period of 15 years. This project is part of an existing partnership between Ncondezi Energy and GridX Africa signed in October 2019. The agreement provided for the supply of small solar power plants with storage systems to businesses in several African countries.
