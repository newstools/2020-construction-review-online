A new 33 MW power plant is set to be constructed in Guinea to power Lefa mine, one of the world’s largest gold mines owned by Nordgold Group, in a bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and provide sustainable power generation for the mine. The plant will be designed and constructed by China manufacturing service group SUMEC, a member of China National Machinery Industry Corporation (SINOMACH), following an engineering, procurement and construction agreement signed with the gold producer. The new heavy fuel oil facility is expected to be delivered by the end of 2021 at a cost of around US$23m. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of heavy industry machinery and the largest shipbuilding company based in Ulsan, South Korea, will supply the power plant’s main generating equipment.

Hundreds of additional jobs will also be created during the course of the construction. Upon completion, the new power plant to be constructed in Guinea will replace the existing power plant consequently reducing both fuel consumption for electricity production by 15% and engine oil by 30%. This will result in reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 17,000 tons a year which is in favor of Nordgold’s climate change objective as well as its commitments to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. “The power plant will enable a significant reduction in operating costs, enhance the stability of the electricity supply for over 15 years of Lefa’s life of mine and furthermore, increase employee safety with the installation of the latest fire detection systems,” stated the Nordgold Group.
