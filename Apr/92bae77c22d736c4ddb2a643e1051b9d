The National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC) has awarded two contracts to the Heavy Civil Infrastructure Business of Larsen & Toubro, to build Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) Infrastructure in Uttar Pradesh, India. The scope of the project is to execute a new, dedicated, high speed, high capacity rail
system in the Delhi – Gaziabad – Meerut Corridor. RRTS is distinct from metro transit systems as it caters to passengers traveling relatively longer distances with fewer stops and at higher speed. The design speed for the project is 180 KMPH with an average operational speed of 100KMPH. According to  Mr. S V Desai, Senior Vice President & Head – Heavy Civil Infrastructure IC, L&T Construction, they are delighted to have been entrusted with responsibility to develop this RRTS in India, a first-of-its-kind for India. “This is a reaffirmation of our proven capability to build faster and reliable mass transit systems that are in sync with our strategic goal of aiding rapid transportation infrastructure development,” he said. The two contracts for RRTS in India have been secured for packages starting from Duhai to Modi Nagar and from Modi Nagar to Shatabdi Nagar for a total distance of approximately 32 Km viaduct including 7 elevated stations.
