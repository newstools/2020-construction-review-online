When it opens, this new multi functional port implemented by Poly Technologies Inc. a subsidiary of China Poly Group Corporation Ltd at the mouth of the Senegal River should increase the country’s logistical support and maritime transport capacities, strengthen the operational capacities of the armed forces in the face of security challenges and strengthen the sovereignty of the State in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). It is also expected to promote the possibility of opening a line for fluvial transport on the Senegal River, over a distance of nearly 15 km from the port, to supply the Mauritanian cities located along the river, to Mali. Furthermore it will constitute an essential infrastructure for the exploitation of the Grand Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) gas project. The Grand Tortue Ahmeyim (GTA) gas project, situated on the Mauritanian-Senegalese maritime border, is run by a joint venture involving British Petroleum (BP), as the operator, American-owned Kosmos Energy, the Mauritania Hydrocarbon and Road Assets Society (SMHPM), and the Senegal National Petroleum Society (PETROSEN). The gas reserves were discovered in 2015 and based on Kosmos Energy and BP’s predictions, the first gas production is expected in the first half of 2022. In regards to liquefied natural gas, the output will be destined for export and domestic consumption in Mauritania and Senegal.
