Construction of a 225MW combined cycle power plant in Sylhet, Bangladesh is complete. The power plant which was constructed by Shanghai Electric Group replaces an old 150MW simple cycle gas turbine power plant in Sylhet and is expected to meet the growing electricity in the eastern region of Bangladesh. The project which features a 100MW GVIP air-cooled generator will also help in reducing emission while ensuring higher thermal efficiency at the plant. The plant uses Global Vacuum Pressure Impregnation (GVPI) technology on the 100MW air-cooled generator. Shanghai Electric has also improved the efficiency of the original plant’s simple open-cycle application from 33% to 55%.

This has helped to increase the plant’s capacity by 90MW with less maintenance requirements. Before the upgrade, the plant used to generate 8.19 billion kWh of electricity and with the upgrade, the electricity generated will increase by another 640 million kWh on an annual basis. The project was developed as a partnership between the region’s Power Development Board (PDB) and Shanghai Electric. It is the Chinese company’s fourth engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project in the country. According to Sylhet’s project chief engineer Wang Yi, retrofitting the gas turbine generator technology to convert from simple, open-cycle systems to combined-cycle operation requires skill and dedicated service and the company has built solid experience through overall 5 projects in Bangladesh so far since 2002. “We are always looking ahead to anticipate client’s needs and improve the availability, reliability and efficiency through customized solution designed for different regional markets,” he added.
