Construction works on water towers across eight localities in the Kara region of Togo is on track. Director General of the Togolese Water Company (TDE), Yawanke Waké Gbati confirmed the progress and said the project will strengthen drinking water supply in this northern region of the country. “The work is progressing well and there has been an increase in production thanks to the connection of some boreholes to the network. I together with Director General of the Urban and Semi-Urban Water and Sanitation Heritage Company (SP-Eau) Assoutom Koumayi visited the main source of drinking water in the Kara region and it is more than two metres higher than last year,”  said Yawanke Waké Gbati.

The water towers equipped with modular tanks, have been sited in Niamtougou, Baga, Défalé, Kanté, Kara, Kémérida, Bassar and Guérin-Kouka localities. The water towers feature standard size panels that are easy to assemble and disassemble. The height of the installations is between 12 and 15 metres. The castles have a storage capacity that varies between 50 m3 and 300 m3. The overall cost of the project is US $2m “These castles have the advantage of being a sustainable, economical, ecological and quality solution that meets international drinking water standards,” says Yawanke Waké Gbati, managing director of TDE. The new model of tank is relatively less expensive compared to the reinforced concrete tank, but still has a life span of more than 25 years,” said Yawanke Waké Gbati.
