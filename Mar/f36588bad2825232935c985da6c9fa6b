Construction of the Mwache-Mteza bridge in Kenya has kicked off. This is after the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) availed US $1m as part of compensation for affected persons. Kinango MP Benjamin Tayari revealed the report and said that the money was forwarded to the National Land Commission (NLC) and disbursements are set to start anytime. “NLC has forwarded the names to the Ethics and Anti-corruption Corruption Commission for vetting, to ensure that only the right landowners are compensated to avoid fraud,” said Mr Benjamin. The project is part of phase two of the Dongo Kundu bypass project. It will be a 1,440m long stretch between Mwache Junction and Mteza with Fujita Corporation as the project contractors. 90% of the jobs have been given to the locals.
