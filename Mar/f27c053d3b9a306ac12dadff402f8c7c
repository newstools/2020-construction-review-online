The project started in 2015 and was funded to the tune of US $15m under the Japanese Grant Aid. The Department of Irrigation under the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water and Rural Resettlement and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) were involved in the rehabilitation and development of the facility.
