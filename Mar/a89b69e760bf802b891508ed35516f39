Construction of the proposed Regional Road in Lekki-Ajah axis in Eti-Osa Local Government Area, Nigeria is set to commence in May. Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu revealed the report and said the project will commence despite encroachment on the right of way. “The government is set to remove the contraventions to give way for the construction of the Regional Road. The design and alignment of the road will be remodeled in order to reclaim the right-of-way already encroached on by property developers along the corridor,” said Mr. Babajide.

This according to the governor is because the road is very strategic in the implementation of Lekki Masterplan Development. “The road, which is parallel to Lekki-Epe Expressway, is strategic for us in our Lekki Masterplan Development programme. While we went round the alignment, we discovered that there are so many estates behind this place. There has been encroachment on the identified right-of-way. What we are doing now is to see how to resolve all these issues before we go into final tendering process to pick the would-be contractor for the job,” said Governor Sanwo-Olu. Upon completion of the road, it will not only give relief, but it would also enhance movement and improve quality of life for the residents. It will also ease the Fourth Mainland Bridge and ease pressure off the Lekki-Epe Expressway.
