The Gauteng Provincial Government in SA has unveiled a new US $30.7bn development plan for the province over the next decade. The documents shows that the construction will be implemented along five development corridors that have distinct industries and different comparative advantages. These corridors are: The Central Development Corridor, anchored on the city of Johannesburg as the hub of finance, services, information and communication technology, and pharmaceutical industries; the Eastern Development Corridor, built around the economy of the Ekurhuleni metro as the hub of manufacturing, logistics and transport industries; the Northern Development Corridor, anchored on Tshwane as the administrative capital city and the hub of the automotive sector, research, development, innovation and the knowledge-based economy; the Western Corridor, encompassing the economy of the West Rand district and the creation of new industries, new economic nodes and new cities. The Southern Corridor, encompassing the economy of the Sedibeng district and the creation of new industries, new economic nodes and new cities. “In the centre and in all four corners of the province, the development of economic corridors was underway,” the authors state. “This monumental strategy had forever altered sole reliance on a skewed capital-intensive productive base, dominated as it had been by large enterprises principally operating in only three of Gauteng’s metro areas. “Regional economic inclusiveness was now showing signs of breaking past the dismal employment status quo and opening up the possibility of keeping up with future demands for jobs.” Also Read: Saldanha Bay industrial Development Zone signs US $18.3m new investment deals The Northern Development Corridor will unlock over US $3.7bn in investment which will go towards the development of a new high-tech special economic zone and automotive special economic zone; the development of the Rosslyn Auto City; the continued development of Menlyn Maine; Consolidating and regenerating existing areas (CBD, Centurion and Silverton); and revitilising infrastructure in townships to create economic opportunities.
