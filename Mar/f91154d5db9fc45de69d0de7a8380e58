Construction of US $4bn Central Park Tower in New York has been suspended in response to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) crisis in the city. Central Park Tower is a 95-story condo tower at 217 West 57th Street along Billionaireâ€™s Row that is projected to be the most expensive residential tower in the city. A seven-story Nordstrom at the base of the tower opened in 2019. New York City is the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, with more than 13,000 cases in the city alone as of 23rd March. While all non-essential businesses have been ordered closed in New York City since 22nd March, some construction sites have remained open.

The firm is based in Chicago and has an impressive portfolio of other skyscrapers around the world. They are the architect for the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, the One Dubai in the UAE and have even ventured into China where the Wuhan Greenland Center is another feather in their cap. The developers hope to bag in the range of US $4bn if all the units are taken up. The architect has chosen a shiny exterior consisting of glass and steel that has a satin finish. The building cantilevers on the eastern-side at about 300 feet up to offer residents stunning views of central park.
