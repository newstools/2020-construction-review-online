Construction of the US $40bn Woodfibre LNG project in Southwest of Squamish has been delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 (Coronavirus) pandemic. According to Project spokeswoman Rebecca Scott, substantial construction expected to start this summer won’t take place until after the middle of next year after a fabrication yard in Asia that was making components for the project was shut down to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The much larger LNG Canada project recently announced it will reduce the size of its construction workforce at Kitimat, B.C., by half to help local communities deal with COVID-19. The company is now applying to the B.C. Environmental Assessment Office for a five-year extension to its environmental certificate which expires in October.

The plant is licensed to export 2.1 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year for 40 years. Ms. Scott further added that the key thing is that they are full steam ahead. “We are still meeting all of our pre-construction commitments. Really nothing changes for us except our projection for start of construction,” she said. Construction is expected to take about four years.
