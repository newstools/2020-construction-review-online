The U.S. Army has awarded US $524m to Southwest Valley Constructors for design and build of a section of wall along the U.S. Mexico border, the Department of Defense has announced. In February, SWVC received a US $175.4m contract for border wall construction in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. The deal modifies an earlier US $646m contract, originally awarded in May 2019, to replace the fencing structure on the Tucson sector, which encompasses 262 miles of border area covering the New Mexico state and Yuma county lines.

The Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recently announced plans to erect more than 150 miles of the 30ft border wall in Arizona, New Mexico and California; in addition to ongoing construction works in at least 15 sites across those states and Texas. Southwest Valley Constructors (SWVC) is based in Albuquerque, New Mexico and specializes in large-scale construction for the federal government. Through its affiliation with the Omaha-based, multibillion-dollar construction firm Kiewit, the SWVC team has a proven history of working with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Kiewit has also received about US $1.8bn in border wall contracts. The project has an estimated completion date of September 7th, 2021.
