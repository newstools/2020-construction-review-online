The construction of Deloitte’s ultramodern premises in Midrad, South Africa has now been completed and set to open in April 2020 according to property developer Atterbury. The 44,000 meters square premise which will be Deloitte’s African head office will accommodate 3,500 staff members but the firm aims to extend the capacity to 5,000 in the next 12 years. Construction began in late 2017 and the premise consolidates Deloitte’s offices in Pretoria and Woodmead into a single, central station. The US $95.7m project has six floors of office space, four basement floors for parking and have nearly 2,000 parking bays fitted with smart occupancy sensors to indicate available spaces according to Atterbury development manager Arno du Plessis. It is also connected to the public transport system to encourage the use of public means instead of individual cars.

Moreover, Construction Major WBHO contracts manager Colin Campbell said that the company had to build angled casting slabs in order to accommodate landscaping on the outside and to ensure optimal water drainage. The building incorporates the green initiatives, including that 20% of the building material consists of recycled content including cardboard, plastics, concrete, and rebar. About 75 percent of the building’s construction waste will be reused or recycled. The building was constructed with about 5,000t of steel reinforcing 50 000 cubic meters of concrete and 3.5-million bricks. In addition, Atterbury and Attacq had 250kVA of solar panels installed on the roof to power about 5% of the building’s power requirements and for backup. Two 1,650kVA diesel generators were also installed with a capacity to generate 3.32MW of power.
