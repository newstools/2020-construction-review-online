The Federal Executive Council (FEC) in Nigeria has approved US $80.6m for the construction of two roads linking two Northern states to the border of Niger Republic. According to the Minister of Works, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, the approval was the fallout of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) he presented to the council for the construction of a 46km road from Balle in Sokoto State to Niger Republic border at the cost of US $26.2m. “The contract will be executed within a period of 24 months,” he said. The minister further confirmed that the council approved another US $54.4m for the construction of phase II of the project, which will involve a 50km road from Kunia in Jigawa State to the Niger Republic border. “The Ministry of Works and Housing presented one memorandum for the award of roads. The first is Balle – Kurdulla -Niger Republic border road in Sokoto which was awarded to Messrs North Sea Limited joint venture; the second one is for Kunya – Niger Republic border phase II which is in Jigawa State,” he said.

So, this is a good boost for business as well,” he affirmed.
