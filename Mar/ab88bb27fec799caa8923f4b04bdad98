Reconstruction works of houses in West Pokot in Kenya has commenced. West Pokot Governor H.E John Lonyangapuo presided over the flagging off the project. The project comes as a result of heavy rains experienced in most parts of the country in 2019 with peaks rising in the months of October-December. This has led to flooding and landslides in many counties including Isiolo, Marsabit, Garissa, Kisumu, Siaya, Migori, Turkana, and Machakos, and landslides/ mudslides in West Pokot, Murang’a, Meru, and Taita Taveta counties. The Kenya Red Cross Society is implementing the reconstruction on behalf of the County Government of West Pokot and the National Government Ministry of Interior. A total of 225 households in West Pokot South and Central sub-counties will benefit from the project. The Government of Kenya through the Ministry of Interior invited the Kenya Red Cross Society to form part of the National Disaster Coordination Committee which was set up by the Cabinet Secretary Hon. Dr Fred Matiangi to coordinate response and early recovery. A total of US $321,000 is going to be spent on the project.

We know that the long rains will be here with us in less than two months and therefore it is a race against time to ensure that the houses are completed,” said Governor Lonyangapuo.
