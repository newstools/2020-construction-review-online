The Ministry of Transport and Communication Zambia has signed a US $825m contract with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation a subsidiary of China Railway Construction Corporation Limited that will see the modified engineering, rehabilitation and upgrade of existing Railway lines in the country. These include the mainline from Livingstone to Kafue Bridge which is 420.97km long, the branch line from Masuku to Choma which is 64.34km long and another branch line from Livingstone to Mulobezi which is 162.95km long. According to the Zambian government, the project will cover nearly 650km of railway lines and will be completed in eight years. The main railway spine through the country today is the Zambia Railways line from Livingstone, via Lusaka, to Kitwe in the north, used by passenger and freight trains. At Kapiri Mposhi there is a junction with Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority (TAZARA) that is used by freight trains but not passenger. TAZARA has its own passenger trains, but the passenger stations of the two railways at Kapiri Mposhi are separated by a distance of around 2km. Livingstone is also the junction with the Mulobezi line, and with the line from Zimbabwe via theÂ Victoria Falls Bridge.
