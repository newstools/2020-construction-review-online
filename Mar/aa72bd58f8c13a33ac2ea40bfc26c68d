The construction of Mandela market in Sumbawanga Town, Rukwa region which was reduced to ashes on December 26, 2016 is set to cost nearly US $1m upon its completion before the end of the financial year. During his tour to the town in October last year, President John Magufuli directed Sumbawanga Municipal Council to allocate US $129,853 from its domestic revenues for building damaged business structures for the fire victims. He further gave a one month ultimatum to the municipality to construct damaged business structures. He also ordered the council to allocate business areas for the victims with immediate effect. “Victims should not be disturbed or forced to pay revenues until the construction of their destroyed business structures are built,” said the president.
