The construction of US $3.8m Lilongwe access roads in Areas 13, 16 and 19 in Lilongwe city, Malawi is almost complete. The roads with a total length of 6.2km are being constructed by the Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development. Speaking after touring the project, newly appointed Minister of Lands, Housing and Urban Development Kamlepo Kalua said he was contented with the progress and standards of the roads being constructed. However, he was concerned about the quality of structures being constructed in the area saying that they are of low quality in standards. “The world is changing and we are also changing, I am warning these developers that their time is up, if they cannot afford to construct buildings that are in line with the modern world they should tell us so that we give the plots to those who can manage. We want serious developers who can change the outlook of Malawi, Lilongwe in particular,” he said.
