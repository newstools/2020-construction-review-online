The government of South Africa is set to kick off the ambitious project to construct 100 schools and six hospitals in Gauteng province as well as reopening of 70 townships schools that were initially not attracting enrollment numbers. The announcement was made by Gauteng Premier Mr. David Makhura during his State of the Province Address (SoPA) in Tshwane. Mr. Makhura said the project will address the shortage of learning facilities in the province. He added that despite government efforts to streamline the placement of children in schools the challenge remains as more parents scramble for high performing schools. In addition, Makhura said the provincial government will also invest more in technical schools and schools of specialization. “Every district will have at least two schools of specialization linked to the 10 high-growth sectors,” he said.
