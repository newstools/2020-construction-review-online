Austrian packaging manufacturer Alpla is building a new production site near Johannesburg which will combine activities from five existing plants. As part of the consolidation, the production of five existing plants in Harrismith, Denver, Isando, Kempton Park and Samrand will be transferred to the new plant in Lanseria. Located in the province of Gauteng, the factory aims to simplify and optimise manufacturing processes while also contributing to improving logistics and transport. Standard bottle solutions and tailor-made packaging for the food, personal care, home care, chemical, detergent and pharmaceutical industries will continue to be manufactured at the new plant. In the past five years, Alpla has significantly expanded its market presence in Africa with several acquisitions, in particular, South-African based Boxmore Packaging, which specialises in creating PET bottles, PET preforms and closures for drinks bottles. With the construction of a new production site in South Africa, Alpla aims to create long-term growth and competitiveness in the Sub-Saharan African region. “Our new plant in Lanseria gives us the opportunity to produce according to modern, globally applicable corporate standards. In this way, we not only improve the quality of our products but also meet the high demands of our global customers”, said Christoph Riedlsperger, Alpla regional director for Africa, the Middle East and Turkey. As part of the consolidation, the management contemplates that more than 50 employees would be impacted. Construction for the new plant began in February 2020 and is expected to be completed by summer 2021.
