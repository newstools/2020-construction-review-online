There are approximately 72,000km of roads in the country out of which 23% had been asphalted with 39% in good condition while the rest are classified as fair or poor “It is regrettable fact that their inner roads are left to deteriorate to unacceptable state but thank God, his excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has come to do it and he has declared this year, “the year of roads” and, we are beneficiaries. Major roads within the Municipality will go through asphalt overlay but deteriorating surfaces will see reconstruction first. We are going to cut and put crush rocks where the road is a bit worse,” said Kwesi Amoako-Atta.
