Funding to Solar hydrowatt, a company operating in village hydraulics, will be used to install a hybrid system in Fotetsa, a group of villages in the commune of Dschang in the west of Cameroon. The hybrid system will have a capacity of 120 kW in hydropower and 15 kWp in solar photovoltaic energy and will provide access to electricity for approximately 1,500 people. Experience Incorporated Cameroon, a cooperative which specialises in potato production will use its financing for its agricultural projects in the production basin of Santa, a commune located in the North-West region. While Cameroon is not yet on track to meet the targets of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for water and sanitation, it has made notable progress since 1990, much more needs to be done to improve the situation, especially in rural areas. In 2006, 70% of the population had access to safe drinking water and the coverage in urban centres is 88%, significantly better than the 47% in rural areas. However, rapid urbanization has rendered existing infrastructure inadequate with periurban dwellers also lacking access to safe drinking water. Sanitation coverage is also poor. In urban areas only 58% of the population has access to improved sanitation facilities, and the rate in rural areas is 42%
