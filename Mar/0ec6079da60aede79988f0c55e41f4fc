He added that the bad road condition also stopped people from trading. “For too long citizens of the four Marvoh Towns have suffered from bad road condition, which has led the district with a lot of challenges in getting access to basic services. The county authority will monitor the road construction from its start till the finish. Upon completion it will be a gateway for economic growth for people within the district,” said Mr. Erkan. The road network in Liberia is greatly underdeveloped and among the least developed in West Africa. Liberia has a total area of 111,370 km² and a road system with a total length of 10,600 km. Of these, only 657 km are paved while 9,943 km are unpaved. There is major deterioration on all highways due to heavy rains, lack of maintenance, overloaded trucks and the long rainy season which lasts 8 months, during which most of the roads are inaccessible, particularly in Nimba, Lofa, Sinoe, Baporlu and Maryland counties. Out of the 10,600 km roads in Liberia, less than a quarter are classified as all-weather roads. The road between Monrovia and Ganta was paved in 2015 and is in good condition and the road between Monrovia and Buchanan Port is paved and in good condition.
