The Moroccan Ministry of Energy has granted British industrial company Sound Energy full rights to carry out its Tendrara Gas Export Pipeline project. This is after the ministry approved the project’s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), related to the establishment of a gas treatment plant and compression station (CPF). The approvals were granted following meetings with the National Committee from the Moroccan Ministry of Energy, in October 2019 and January 2020, to review the CPF EIA. The company expressed satisfaction with discussions between its personnel and Moroccan Ministry of Interior and Forestry Department representatives, which led to the approval of a “long-term lease agreement”. Under the agreement, the company will establish a 50m wide corridor along the entire 120km length of the pipeline project.
