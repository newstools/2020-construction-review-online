Algeria aspires to protect its water resources and to provide a sustainable answer to water supply and management issues by carrying out a national water plan. This program is in line with all projects the Algerian Government is implementing to improve its water sector performance. The main objective of the country’s water policy consists on providing sufficient potable water for the population supply. This objective is undertaken by increasing the water resources and availability. The country is made up of 95% arid land and 80% desert leading to the scarcity of water. They source out their drinking water from the region’s few reservoirs and long-distance water transfers.
