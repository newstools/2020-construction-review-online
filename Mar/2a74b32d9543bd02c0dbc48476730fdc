The remainder of the harvested bushes would also be used to produce charcoal for commercial purposes. The minister also pointed out that the project will be a multi-million-dollar factory built by the government’s National Industrial Development Agency (Nida) in partnership with private investors, who are expected to inject funds, technical expertise and knowledge. “There will be a lot of industrial activity and job creation in manufacturing, value addition and processing of wood to a finished product. The Finnish government, the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido), and the Baobab Growth Fund organisation, among others, would also be involved in funding the project,” said Tweya. The charcoal industry is a fairly new industry in Namibia, being an innovative by-product
of clearing invader bush. The industry grew significantly in the 2001–2010 period, and has
now become an important economic sector. Its development as a labour-intensive industry
has in turn attracted indigent and unskilled labourers who, however, fall outside the usual
protection of the labour and health and safety laws because the industry itself remains
unregulated.
